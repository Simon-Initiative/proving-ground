It is the second of a two-course sequence. Primary topics such as the history of life, body systems, and ecology are covered in this course.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">This course was developed by Lumen Learning, with contributing work from Shelli Carter. The course is based on the OpenStax textbook <a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/biology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biology</a>, supplemented with relevant materials from <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khan Academy</a> and videos from multiple sources. Original practice activities were authored by Shelli Carter and Lumen Learning in the development of this course.</p> <h2>About Lumen</h2> <p>Lumen Learning’s mission is to make great learning opportunities available to all students, regardless of socioeconomic background.</p> <p>We do this by using open educational resources (OER) to create well-designed and low-cost course materials that replace expensive textbooks. Because learning is about more than affordability and access, we also apply learning science insights and efficacy research to develop learning activities that are engineered to improve subject mastery, course completion and retention.</p> <p>If you’d like to connect with us to learn more about adopting this course, please <a href="http://lumenlearning.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact Us</a>.</p> <p>You can also <a href="https://calendly.com/lumenlearning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make an appointment</a> for <a href="http://lumenlearning.com/office-hours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OER Office Hours</a> to connect virtually with a live Lumen expert about any question you may have.</p> </div> </div> </div><div class="licensing"><div class="license-attribution-dropdown-subheading">CC licensed content, Original</div><ul class="citation-list"><li>About This Course. <strong>Provided by</strong>: Lumen Learning. <strong>License</strong>: <em><a target="_blank" rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY: Attribution</a></em></li></ul></div>

As she paged through the article, Cristina became increasingly interested in the different features these animals had: some were eyeless, some were colorless, and others had even stranger features.</p> <p>Before Cristina could dig deeper into these animals, she got a message from her cousin Samuel. He&#8217;d sent a link to an article about genetically modified foods and the dangers they inherently contain.

Cristina started to read the article, but before she got too far, she remembered that she had a paper due the next day. She made a mental note to come back to the articles from her cousin, and she bookmarked the animals article.</p> <p>Though Cristina might not realize it, she&#8217;s just been presented with three different biological questions. How did these animals develop such unique characteristics? Are GMOs dangerous?

This may sound like a silly question with an obvious response, but it is not always easy to define life. For example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses, which exhibit some of the characteristics of living entities but lack others. It turns out that although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and even reproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life. Consequently, virologists are not biologists, strictly speaking. Similarly, some biologists study the early molecular evolution that gave rise to life; since the events that preceded life are not biological events, these scientists are also excluded from biology in the strict sense of the term.</p> <p>From its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with these&nbsp;questions: What are the shared properties that make something “alive”? And once we know something is alive, how do we find meaningful levels of organization in its structure?</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>Learning Objectives</h3> <ul><li>List the properties of life</li> <li>Order the levels of organization of living things</li> </ul> </div> <h2>Properties of Life</h2> <p>All living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or response to the environment, reproduction, growth and development, regulation, homeostasis, and energy processing.

A toad represents a highly organized structure consisting of cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.</p> </div> <p>Organisms are highly organized, coordinated structures that consist of one or more cells.

Tissues, in turn, collaborate to create organs (body structures with a distinct function). Organs work together to form organ systems.</p> <h3>Sensitivity or Response to Stimuli</h3> <p>Organisms respond to diverse stimuli.

Multicellular organisms often produce specialized reproductive germline cells that will form new individuals. When reproduction occurs, genes containing DNA are passed along to an organism’s offspring. These genes ensure that the offspring will belong to the same species and will have similar characteristics, such as size and shape.</p> <h3>Growth and Development</h3> <div id="attachment_1102" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1102" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/04/07212344/puppies.jpg" alt="a mother dog nursing approximately five puppies. three are black, one is brown, and the other is pale yellow.

These genes provide instructions that will direct cellular growth and development, ensuring that a species’ young (Figure 3) will grow up to exhibit many of the same characteristics as its parents.</p> <h3>Regulation</h3> <p>Even the smallest organisms are complex and require multiple regulatory mechanisms to coordinate internal functions, respond to stimuli, and cope with environmental stresses. Two examples of internal functions regulated in an organism are nutrient transport and blood flow. Organs (groups of tissues working together) perform specific functions, such as carrying oxygen throughout the body, removing wastes, delivering nutrients to every cell, and cooling the body.</p> <h3>Homeostasis</h3> <div id="attachment_1511" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1511" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02201807/Figure_01_02_12.jpg" alt="A photos shows a white, furry polar bear." width="350" height="250" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02201807/Figure_01_02_12.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02201807/Figure_01_02_12-300x214.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02201807/Figure_01_02_12-65x46.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02201807/Figure_01_02_12-225x160.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02201807/Figure_01_02_12-350x250.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4. Polar bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) and other mammals living in ice-covered regions maintain their body temperature by generating heat and reducing heat loss through thick fur and a dense layer of fat under their skin. (credit: “longhorndave”/Flickr)</p> </div> <p>In order to function properly, cells need to have appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, pH, and appropriate concentration of diverse chemicals. These conditions may, however, change from one moment to the next. Organisms are able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes, through&nbsp;<strong>homeostasis</strong> (literally, “steady state”)—the ability of an organism to maintain constant internal conditions. For example, an organism needs to regulate body temperature through a process known as thermoregulation. Organisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear (Figure 4), have body structures that help them withstand low temperatures and conserve body heat. Structures that aid in this type of insulation include fur, feathers, blubber, and fat. In hot climates, organisms have methods (such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that help them to shed excess body heat.</p> <h3>Energy Processing</h3> <p>All organisms use a source of energy for their metabolic activities. Some organisms capture energy from the sun and convert it into chemical energy in food (photosynthesis); others use chemical energy in molecules they take in as food (cellular respiration).</p> <div id="attachment_1101" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1101 size-large" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/04/07205837/California-condor-e1460062775102-1024x366.jpg" alt="A california condor perched on a cliff's edge.

The <strong>atom</strong> is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter. It consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. Atoms form molecules. A <strong>molecule</strong> is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds. Many molecules that are biologically important are <strong>macromolecules</strong>, large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization (a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers, which are simpler than macromolecules). An example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Figure 6), which contains the instructions for the structure and functioning of all living organisms.</p> <div id="attachment_1165" style="width: 191px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-1165" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/04/08172216/ADN_animation.gif" alt="Molecular model depicts a DNA molecule, showing its double helix structure." width="181" height="313" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 6. All molecules, including this DNA molecule, are composed of atoms. (credit: “brian0918″/Wikimedia Commons)</p> </div> <p>Some cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes; these are called&nbsp;<strong>organelles</strong>. Organelles are small structures that exist within cells. Examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts, which carry out indispensable functions: mitochondria produce energy to power the cell, while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugars. All living things are made of cells; the <strong>cell</strong> itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms. (This requirement is why viruses are not considered living: they are not made of cells. To make new viruses, they have to invade and hijack the reproductive mechanism of a living cell; only then can they obtain the materials they need to reproduce.) Some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular. Cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic. <strong>Prokaryotes</strong> are single-celled or colonial organisms that do not have membrane-bound nuclei or organelles; in contrast, the cells of <strong>eukaryotes</strong> do have membrane-bound organelles and a membrane-bound nucleus.</p> <p>In larger organisms, cells combine to make&nbsp;<strong>tissues</strong>, which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions. <strong>Organs</strong> are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function. Organs are present not only in animals but also in plants. An <strong>organ system</strong> is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs. Mammals have many organ systems. For instance, the circulatory system transports blood through the body and to and from the lungs; it includes organs such as the heart and blood vessels. <strong>Organisms</strong> are individual living entities. For example, each tree in a forest is an organism. Single-celled prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes are also considered organisms and are typically referred to as microorganisms.</p> <p>All the individuals of a species living within a specific area are collectively called a&nbsp;<strong>population</strong>. For example, a forest may include many pine trees. All of these pine trees represent the population of pine trees in this forest. Different populations may live in the same specific area. For example, the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants and also insects and microbial populations. A <strong>community</strong> is the sum of populations inhabiting a particular area. For instance, all of the trees, flowers, insects, and other populations in a forest form the forest’s community. The forest itself is an ecosystem. An <strong>ecosystem</strong> consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic, non-living parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water. At the highest level of organization (Figure 7), the <strong>biosphere</strong> is the collection of all ecosystems, and it represents the zones of life on earth. It includes land, water, and even the atmosphere to a certain extent.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <p>From a single organelle to the entire biosphere, living organisms are parts of a highly structured hierarchy.</p> <div id="attachment_4598" style="width: 1033px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-4598" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/04/14154237/Figure_01_02_15.jpg" alt="A flow chart shows the hierarchy of living organisms.

This figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic cell.</p> </div> <p>A <strong>prokaryotic cell</strong> is a simple, single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-bound organelle. We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic DNA is found in the central part of the cell: a darkened region called the nucleoid (Figure 1).</p> <p>Unlike Archaea and eukaryotes, bacteria have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, comprised of sugars and amino acids, and many have a polysaccharide capsule (Figure 1). The cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to attach to surfaces in its environment. Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella are used for locomotion, while most pili are used to exchange genetic material during a type of reproduction called conjugation.</p> <h2>Eukaryotic Cells</h2> <p>In nature, the relationship between form and function is apparent at all levels, including the level of the cell, and this will become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells. The principle “form follows function” is found in many contexts. It means that, in general, one can deduce the function of a structure by looking at its form, because the two are matched. For example, birds and fish have streamlined bodies that allow them to move quickly through the medium in which they live, be it air or water.</p> <p>A <strong>eukaryotic cell</strong> is a cell that has a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound compartments or sacs, called <strong>organelles</strong>, which have specialized functions. The word eukaryotic means “true kernel” or “true nucleus,” alluding to the presence of the membrane-bound nucleus in these cells. The word “organelle” means “little organ,” and, as we learned earlier,&nbsp;organelles have specialized cellular functions, just as the organs of your body have specialized functions.</p> <h2>Cell Size</h2> <p>At 0.1–5.0 µm in diameter, prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which have diameters ranging from 10–100 µm (Figure 2). The small size of prokaryotes allows ions and organic molecules that enter them to quickly spread to other parts of the cell. Similarly, any wastes produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly move out. However, larger eukaryotic cells have evolved different structural adaptations to enhance cellular transport. Indeed, the large size of these cells would not be possible without these adaptations. In general, cell size is limited because volume increases much more quickly than does cell surface area. As a cell becomes larger, it becomes more and more difficult for the cell to acquire sufficient materials to support the processes inside the cell, because the relative size of the surface area across which materials must be transported declines.</p> <div id="attachment_1514" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1514" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02202243/Figure_04_02_02-1024x639.jpg" alt="Part a: Relative sizes on a logarithmic scale, from 0.1 nm to 1 m, are shown.

Prokaryotic cells range in diameter from 0.1–5.0 µm.</p> <p>Like a prokaryotic cell, a eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes, but a eukaryotic cell is typically larger than a prokaryotic cell, has a true nucleus (meaning its DNA is surrounded by a membrane), and has other membrane-bound organelles that allow for compartmentalization of functions.

Biologists, however, are always alert to levels of organization, have identified three unique measures of life’s variation.</p> <ul><li>The most precise and specific measure of biodiversity is&nbsp;<strong>variation within a species</strong>.

Phylogenetic relationships provide information on shared ancestry but not necessarily on how organisms are similar or different.</p> <p>Scientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms. A&nbsp;<strong>phylogenetic tree</strong> is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms. Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one cannot go back to confirm the proposed relationships. In other words, a “tree of life” can be constructed to illustrate when different organisms evolved and to show the relationships among different organisms (Figure 5).</p> <div id="attachment_1482" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1482 size-large" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192630/Figure_20_01_01-1024x308.jpg" alt="The phylogenetic tree in part a is rooted and resembles a living tree, with a common ancestor indicated as the base of the trunk.

Many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor. Scientists call such trees rooted, which means there is a single ancestral lineage (typically drawn from the bottom or left) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate. Notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains—Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya—diverge from a single point and branch off. The small branch that plants and animals (including humans) occupy in this diagram shows how recent and minuscule these groups are compared with other organisms. Unrooted trees don’t show a common ancestor but do show relationships among species.</p> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>Carl Woese and the Phylogenetic Tree</h3> <p>In the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria. The organizational scheme was based mainly on physical features, as opposed to physiology, biochemistry, or molecular biology, all of which are used by modern systematics. The pioneering work of American microbiologist Carl Woese in the early 1970s has shown, however, that life on Earth has evolved along three lineages, now called domains—Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The first two are prokaryotic groups of&nbsp;microbes that lack membrane-enclosed nuclei and organelles. The third domain contains the eukaryotes and includes unicellular microorganisms together with the four original kingdoms (excluding bacteria). Woese defined Archaea as a new domain, and this resulted in a new taxonomic tree (Figure 5a). Many organisms belonging to the Archaea domain live under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles. To construct his tree, Woese used genetic relationships rather than similarities based on morphology (shape).</p> <p>Woese’s tree was constructed from comparative sequencing of the genes that are universally distributed, present in every organism, and conserved (meaning that these genes have remained essentially unchanged throughout evolution). Woese’s approach was revolutionary because comparisons of physical features are insufficient to differentiate between the prokaryotes that appear fairly similar in spite of their tremendous biochemical diversity and genetic variability (Figure 6). The comparison of homologous DNA and RNA sequences provided Woese with a sensitive device that revealed the extensive variability of prokaryotes, and which justified the separation of the prokaryotes into two domains: bacteria and archaea.</p> <div id="attachment_1521" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1521" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02202719/Figure_01_02_17abcd-990x1024.png" alt="Photo depict: A: bacterial cells.

Think about how a grocery store is organized. One large space is divided into departments, such as produce, dairy, and meats. Then each department further divides into aisles, then each aisle into categories and brands, and then finally a single product. This organization from larger to smaller, more specific categories is called a hierarchical system.</p> <p>The taxonomic classification system (also called the Linnaean system after its inventor, Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician) uses a hierarchical model. Moving from the point of origin, the groups become more specific, until one branch ends as a single species. For example, after the common beginning of all life, scientists divide organisms into three large categories called a domain: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Within each domain is a second category called a&nbsp;<strong>kingdom</strong>. After kingdoms, the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are: <strong>phylum</strong>, <strong>class</strong>, <strong>order</strong>, <strong>family</strong>, <strong>genus</strong>, and <strong>species</strong> (Figure 7).</p> <div id="attachment_1207" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1207" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/04/12154439/Figure_20_01_04ab.jpg" alt="The illustration shows the classification of a dog, which belongs in the domain Eukarya, kingdom Animalia, phylum Chordata, class Mammalia, order Carnivore, family Canidae, genus Canis, species Canis lupus, and the subspecies is Canis lupus familiaris." width="544" height="994" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/04/12154439/Figure_20_01_04ab.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/04/12154439/Figure_20_01_04ab-164x300.jpg 164w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/04/12154439/Figure_20_01_04ab-65x119.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/04/12154439/Figure_20_01_04ab-225x411.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/04/12154439/Figure_20_01_04ab-350x640.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 7. The taxonomic classification system uses a hierarchical model to organize living organisms into increasingly specific categories. The common dog, Canis lupus familiaris, is a subspecies of Canis lupus, which also includes the wolf and dingo. (credit “dog”: modification of work by Janneke Vreugdenhil)</p> </div> <p>The kingdom Animalia stems from the Eukarya domain. For the common dog, the classification levels would be as shown in Figure 7. Therefore, the full name of an organism technically has eight terms. For the dog, it is: Eukarya, Animalia, Chordata, Mammalia, Carnivora, Canidae,&nbsp;<em>Canis, </em>and <em>lupus</em>. Notice that each name is capitalized except for species, and the genus and species names are italicized. Scientists generally refer to an organism only by its genus and species, which is its two-word scientific name, in what is called&nbsp;<strong>binomial nomenclature</strong>. Therefore, the scientific name of the dog is <em>Canis lupus</em>. The name at each level is also called a <strong>taxon</strong>. In other words, dogs are in order Carnivora. Carnivora is the name of the taxon at the order level; Canidae is the taxon at the family level, and so forth. Organisms also have a common name that people typically use, in this case, dog. Note that the dog is additionally a subspecies: the “<em>familiaris</em>” in <em>Canis lupus familiaris. </em>Subspecies are members of the same species that are capable of mating and reproducing viable offspring, but they are considered separate subspecies due to geographic or behavioral isolation or other factors.</p> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

Biologists as well as chemists and biochemists can be forensic scientists. Forensic scientists provide scientific evidence for use in courts, and their job involves examining trace materials associated with crimes. Interest in forensic science has increased in the last few years, possibly because of popular television shows that feature forensic scientists on the job. Also, the development of molecular techniques and the establishment of DNA databases have expanded the types of work that forensic scientists can do.</p> <p>Their job activities are primarily related to crimes against people such as murder, rape, and assault. Their work involves analyzing samples such as hair, blood, and other body fluids and also processing DNA (Figure 2) found in many different environments and materials.</p> <p>Forensic scientists also analyze other biological evidence left at crime scenes, such as insect larvae or pollen grains. Students who want to pursue careers in forensic science will most likely be required to take chemistry and biology courses as well as some intensive math courses.</p> </div> <p>Another field of biological study, neurobiology, studies the biology of the nervous system, and although it is considered a branch of biology, it is also recognized as an interdisciplinary field of study known as neuroscience. Because of its interdisciplinary nature, this sub-discipline studies different functions of the nervous system using molecular, cellular, developmental, medical, and computational approaches.</p> <div id="attachment_1519" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1519" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02202559/Figure_01_02_18.jpg" alt="People sitting in the dirt with digging tools." width="350" height="269" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02202559/Figure_01_02_18.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02202559/Figure_01_02_18-300x231.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02202559/Figure_01_02_18-65x50.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02202559/Figure_01_02_18-225x173.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02202559/Figure_01_02_18-350x269.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3. Researchers work on excavating dinosaur fossils at a site in Castellón, Spain. (credit: Mario Modesto)</p> </div> <p>Paleontology, another branch of biology, uses fossils to study life’s history (Figure 3). Zoology and botany are the study of animals and plants, respectively. Biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists, ecologists, or physiologists, to name just a few areas. This is just a small sample of the many fields that biologists can pursue.</p> <p>Biology is the culmination of the achievements of the natural sciences from their inception to today. Excitingly, it is the cradle of emerging sciences, such as the biology of brain activity, genetic engineering of custom organisms, and the biology of evolution that uses the laboratory tools of molecular biology to retrace the earliest stages of life on earth. A scan of news headlines—whether reporting on immunizations, a newly discovered species, sports doping, or a genetically modified food—demonstrates the way biology is active in and important to our everyday world.</p> <h2>Scientific Inquiry</h2> <p>Science deals with testable knowledge about physical phenomena in the universe. The goal of science is to understand how the universe works. Biology focuses on understanding living things. To gain knowledge about nature and physical phenomena, scientists use a particular approach called “scientific inquiry.”</p> <p>Scientific inquiry is the best approach we have to understanding the natural world and predicting natural phenomena. Evidence for this claim can be found in the successes of science-based technologies. Take medicine, for example. Prior to the 1700s, most medical practices were based on folk traditions or on ideas promoted by religious leaders. Some of these prescientific remedies worked, but the process for discovering new treatments was a slow and haphazard system of trial and error. Ineffective treatments were often accepted simply because there was no clear procedure for evaluating them. Today, with science-based medicine and public health practices, we have gained unprecedented control over threats to our health. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the average life expectancy in the United States has increased by more than 30 years since 1900.</p> <p>Scientific inquiry has not displaced faith, intuition, and dreams. These traditions and ways of knowing have emotional value and provide moral guidance to many people. But hunches, feelings, deep convictions, old traditions, or dreams cannot be accepted directly as scientifically valid. Instead, science limits itself to ideas that can be tested through verifiable observations. Supernatural claims that events are caused by ghosts, devils, God, or other spiritual entities cannot be tested in this way.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <p>Your friend sees this image of a circle of mushrooms and excitedly tells you it was caused by fairies dancing in a circle on the grass the night before.

But fairies are magical or supernatural beings. We have never observed them using any verifiable method, so scientists agree that they cannot be studied using scientific tools. Instead, science has an explanation supported by strong evidence: “fairy rings” result when a single colony of fungus spreads out into good habitat over a period of many years. The core area is clear of mushrooms because the soil nutrients have been partly depleted there. This idea can be evaluated with repeated observations over time using chemical soil tests and other verifiable measurements.</div> </div> </div> <h2>Experiments and Hypotheses</h2> <p>Now we’ll&nbsp;focus on the methods of scientific inquiry. Science often involves making&nbsp;observations and developing hypotheses. Experiments and further observations are often used to test the hypotheses.</p> <p>A scientific experiment is a carefully organized procedure in which the scientist intervenes in a system to change something, then observes the result of the change. Scientific inquiry often involves doing experiments, though not always. For example, a scientist studying the mating behaviors of ladybugs might begin with detailed observations of ladybugs mating in their natural habitats. While this research may not be experimental, it is scientific: it involves careful and verifiable observation of the natural world. The same scientist might then treat some of the ladybugs with a hormone hypothesized to trigger mating and observe whether these ladybugs mated sooner or more often than untreated ones. This would qualify as an experiment because the scientist is now making a change in the system and observing the effects.</p> <h3>Forming a Hypothesis</h3> <p>When conducting scientific experiments, researchers develop hypotheses to guide experimental design. A&nbsp;hypothesis is a suggested explanation that is both testable and falsifiable. You must be able to test your hypothesis, and it must be possible to prove your hypothesis true or false.</p> <p>For example, Michael&nbsp;observes that maple trees lose their leaves in the fall. He might then propose a possible explanation for this observation: “cold weather causes maple trees to lose their leaves in the fall.” This statement is testable. He&nbsp;could grow maple trees in a warm enclosed environment such as a greenhouse and see if their leaves still dropped in the fall. The hypothesis is also falsifiable. If the leaves still dropped in the warm environment, then clearly temperature was not the main factor in causing maple leaves to drop in autumn.</p> <p>In the Try It&nbsp;below, you can practice recognizing scientific hypotheses. As you consider each statement, try to think as a scientist would: can I test this hypothesis with observations or experiments? Is the statement falsifiable? If the answer to either of these questions is “no,” the statement is not a valid scientific hypothesis.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Questions</h3> <p>Determine whether each following statement is a scientific hypothesis.</p> <p>Air pollution from automobile exhaust can trigger symptoms in people with asthma.</p> <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>No. This statement is not testable or falsifiable.</li> <li>No. This statement is not testable.</li> <li>No. This statement is not falsifiable.</li> <li>Yes.

The statement might be “falsifiable” if you came up with a counterexample: a “wicked” place that was not punished by a natural disaster. But some would question whether the people in that place were really wicked, and others would continue to predict that a natural disaster was bound to strike that place at some point. There is no reason to suspect that people’s immoral behavior affects the weather unless you bring up the intervention of a supernatural being, making this idea even harder to test.</p> </div> </div> </div> <h3>Testing a Vaccine</h3> <p>Let’s&nbsp;examine the scientific process by discussing an actual scientific experiment conducted by researchers at the University of Washington. These researchers investigated whether a vaccine may reduce the incidence of the human papillomavirus (HPV). The experimental process and results were published in an article titled, “<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12444178" target="_blank">A controlled trial of a human papillomavirus type 16 vaccine</a>.”</p> <p>Preliminary observations made by the researchers who conducted the HPV experiment are listed below:</p> <ul><li>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the United States.</li> <li>There are about 40 different types of HPV. A significant number of people that have HPV are unaware of it because many of these viruses cause no symptoms.</li> <li>Some types of HPV can cause cervical cancer.</li> <li>About 4,000 women a year die of cervical cancer in the United States.</li> </ul> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <p>Researchers have developed a potential vaccine against HPV and want to test it.&nbsp;What is the first testable hypothesis that the researchers should study?</p> <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>HPV causes cervical cancer.</li> <li>People should not have unprotected sex with many partners.</li> <li>People who get the vaccine will not get HPV.</li> <li>The HPV vaccine will protect people against cancer.</li> </ol> <div class="qa-wrapper" style="display: block"><span class="show-answer collapsed" style="cursor: pointer" data-target="q20917"><strong>Show Answer</strong></span> <div id="q20917" class="hidden-answer" style="display: none">Hypothesis A is not the best choice because this information is already known from previous studies. Hypothesis B&nbsp;is not testable because scientific hypotheses are not value statements; they do not include judgments like “should,”&nbsp;“better than,” etc. Scientific evidence certainly might support this value judgment, but a hypothesis&nbsp;would take a different form: “Having unprotected sex with many partners increases a person’s risk for&nbsp;cervical cancer.” Before the researchers can test if the vaccine protects against cancer (hypothesis D), they want to test if it&nbsp;protects against the virus. This statement will make an excellent hypothesis for the next study. The researchers should first test hypothesis C—whether or not the new vaccine can prevent HPV.</div> </div> </div> <h3>Experimental Design</h3> <p>You’ve successfully identified a hypothesis for the University of Washington’s study on HPV: People who get the HPV vaccine will not get HPV.</p> <p>The next step is to design an experiment that will test this hypothesis. There are several important factors to consider when designing a scientific experiment. First, scientific experiments must have an experimental group. This is the group that receives the experimental treatment necessary to address the hypothesis.</p> <p>The experimental group receives the vaccine, but how can we know if the vaccine made a difference? Many things may change HPV infection rates in a group of people over time. To clearly show that the vaccine was effective in helping the experimental group, we need to include in our study an otherwise similar control group that does not get the treatment. We can then compare the two groups and determine if the vaccine made a difference. The control group shows us what happens in the absence of the factor under study.</p> <p>However, the control group cannot get “nothing.” Instead, the control group often receives a placebo. A <em>placebo</em> is a procedure that has no expected therapeutic effect—such as giving a person a sugar pill or a shot containing only plain saline solution with no drug. Scientific studies have shown that the “placebo effect” can alter experimental results because when individuals are told that they are or are not being treated, this knowledge can alter their actions or their emotions, which can then alter the results of the experiment.</p> <p>Moreover, if the doctor knows which group a patient is in, this can also influence the results of the experiment. Without saying so directly, the doctor may show—through body language or other subtle cues—his or her views about whether the patient is likely to get well. These errors can then alter the patient’s experience and change the results of the experiment. Therefore, many clinical studies are “double blind.” In these studies, neither the doctor nor the patient knows which group the patient is in until all experimental results have been collected.</p> <p>Both placebo treatments and double-blind procedures are designed to prevent bias. Bias is any systematic error that makes a particular experimental outcome more or less likely. Errors can happen in any experiment: people make mistakes in measurement, instruments fail, computer glitches can alter data. But most such errors are random and don’t favor one outcome over another. Patients’ belief in a treatment can make it more likely to appear to “work.” Placebos and double-blind procedures are used to level the playing field so that both groups of study subjects are treated equally and share similar beliefs about their treatment.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Questions</h3> <p>The scientists who are researching the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine will test their hypothesis by separating 2,392 young women into two groups: the control group and the experimental group. Answer the following questions about these two groups.</p> <ol><li>Which of the following groups most likely represents the control group? <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>This group is given a placebo.</li> <li>This group is deliberately infected with HPV.</li> <li>This group is given nothing.</li> <li>This group is given the HPV vaccine.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which of the following groups most likely represents the experimental group? <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>This group is given a placebo.</li> <li>This group is deliberately infected with HPV.</li> <li>This group is given nothing.</li> <li>This group is given the HPV vaccine.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <div class="qa-wrapper" style="display: block"><span class="show-answer collapsed" style="cursor: pointer" data-target="q918962"><strong>Show Answers</strong></span> <div id="q918962" class="hidden-answer" style="display: none"><ol><li>a: This group is given a placebo.&nbsp;A placebo will be a shot, just like the HPV vaccine, but it will have no active ingredient. It may&nbsp;change peoples’ thinking or behavior to have such a shot given to them, but it will not stimulate the&nbsp;immune systems of the subjects in the same way as predicted for the vaccine itself.</li> <li>d: This group is given the HPV vaccine.&nbsp;The experimental group will receive the HPV vaccine and researchers will then be able to&nbsp;see if it works, when compared to the control group.</li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> <h3>Experimental Variables</h3> <p>A variable is a characteristic of a subject (in this case, of a person in the study) that can vary over time or among individuals. Sometimes a variable takes the form of a category, such as male or female; often a variable can be measured precisely, such as body height. Ideally, only one variable is different between the control group and the experimental group in a scientific experiment. Otherwise, the researchers will not be able to determine which variable caused any differences seen in the results. For example, imagine that the people in the control group were, on average, much more sexually active than the people in the experimental group. If, at the end of the experiment, the control group had a higher rate of HPV infection, could you confidently determine why? Maybe the experimental subjects were protected by the vaccine, but maybe they were protected by their low level of sexual contact.</p> <p>To avoid this situation, experimenters make sure that their subject groups are as similar as possible in all variables except for the variable that is being tested in the experiment. This variable, or factor, will be deliberately changed in the experimental group. The one variable that is different between the two groups is called the independent variable. An independent variable is known or hypothesized to cause some outcome. Imagine an educational researcher investigating the effectiveness of a new teaching strategy in a classroom. The experimental group receives the new teaching strategy, while the control group receives the traditional strategy. It is the teaching strategy that is the independent variable in this scenario. In an experiment, the independent variable is the variable that the scientist deliberately changes or imposes on the subjects.</p> <p>Dependent variables are known or hypothesized consequences; they are the effects that result from changes or differences in an independent variable. In an experiment, the dependent variables are those that the scientist measures before, during, and particularly at the end of the experiment to see if they have changed as expected. The dependent variable must be stated so that it is clear how it will be observed or measured. Rather than comparing “learning” among students (which is a vague and difficult to measure concept), an educational researcher might choose to compare test scores, which are very specific and easy to measure.</p> <p>In any real-world example, many, many variables MIGHT affect the outcome of an experiment, yet only one or a few independent variables can be tested. Other variables must be kept as similar as possible between the study groups and are called <em>control variables</em>. For our educational research example, if the control group consisted only of people between the ages of 18 and 20 and the experimental group contained people between the ages of 30 and 35, we would not know if it was the teaching strategy or the students’ ages that played a larger role in the results. To avoid this problem, a good study will be set up so that each group contains students with a similar age profile. In a well-designed educational research study, student age will be a controlled variable, along with other possibly important factors like gender, past educational achievement, and pre-existing knowledge of the subject area.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Questions</h3> <p>What is the independent variable in this experiment?</p> <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Sex (all of the subjects will be female)</li> <li>Presence or absence of the HPV vaccine</li> <li>Age</li> <li>Presence or absence of HPV (the virus)</li> </ol> <div class="qa-wrapper" style="display: block"><span class="show-answer collapsed" style="cursor: pointer" data-target="q68680">Show Answer</span> <div id="q68680" class="hidden-answer" style="display: none">Answer b.

<h2>Interpreting Results</h2>
<h3>Gathering Data</h3>
<p>After the experiment is completed, the data gathered are carefully interpreted. This involves the measurement of the dependent variable. In the case of our HPV experiment, remember, the dependent variable is the rate of HPV infection.</p>
<div class="textbox exercises">
<h3>Practice Question</h3>
<p>The researchers found that, of the 1,200 women in the control group, nine were infected with HPV at the end of the study. Of the 1,200 women in the experimental group, zero were infected with HPV. Does this result support the original hypothesis, that the HPV vaccine would reduce HPV infection?</p>
<p><textarea rows="2" cols="50"></textarea></p> <div class="qa-wrapper" style="display: block"><span class="show-answer collapsed" style="cursor: pointer" data-target="q318356"><strong>Show Answer</strong></span> <div id="q318356" class="hidden-answer" style="display: none">The results demonstrate that fewer individuals who got the vaccine were infected with HPV when compared to the number of infected individuals who did not get the vaccine. This supports the hypothesis that the new vaccine protects against HPV.</div> </div> </div> <h3>Significance</h3> <p>Although the HPV study suggests that the vaccine protects against infection by HPV, is the finding significant? In science, as in life, things can happen for many different reasons. A convincing study will rule out “luck” (random chance) as an explanation for the results. Strong results are said to be significant: very unlikely to occur by chance or random events.</p> <p>Whether the outcome is significant often depends on the size of study; the larger the number of individuals enrolled, the more convincing the results are likely to be. For example, imagine only 10 women were enrolled in the study. In the control group, 2 in 5 of the women became infected. In the experimental group, 0 in 5 were infected. At first you might think this proves the vaccine’s effectiveness, but it is NOT a convincing or significant result. Why not? Random events could easily explain the difference between the groups. For example, perhaps none of the five women in the experimental group were sexually active over the study period. They therefore stood no chance of acquiring HPV. The vaccine might appear to work, but a skeptical reader could account for the results by proposing many other scenarios.</p> <p>However, imagine if the same study were done with 10,000 women, and the infection rates were 2,000 of 5,000 in the control group and zero of 5,000 in the experimental group. Random events would be spread out among a very large group of people in this study; on average, the two big groups should have similar sexual behavior and other factors influencing infection rates. If there is a big difference at the end of the study, it is very unlikely that <em class="italic">this</em> result occurred by random chance.</p> <p>Statistical analyses did support the significance of the HPV vaccine result.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <p>Researchers reported significant results from the HPV vaccine experiment.

There are 118 elements, but only 92 occur naturally. The remaining elements are synthesized in laboratories and are unstable.</p> <div><p>Each element is designated by its chemical symbol, which is a single capital letter or, when the first letter is already “taken” by another element, a combination of two letters. Some elements follow the English term for the element, such as C for carbon and Ca for calcium. Other elements’ chemical symbols derive from their Latin names; for example, the symbol for sodium is Na, referring to <em>natrium</em>, the Latin word for sodium.</p> <p>The four elements common to all living organisms are oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). In the non-living world, elements are found in different proportions, and some elements common to living organisms are relatively rare on the earth as a whole, as shown in Table 1. For example, the atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen but contains little carbon and hydrogen, while the earth’s crust, although it contains oxygen and a small amount of hydrogen, has little nitrogen and carbon. In spite of their differences in abundance, all elements and the chemical reactions between them obey the same chemical and physical laws regardless of whether they are a part of the living or non-living world.</p> <table><thead><tr><th colspan="4">Table 1.

An <strong>atom</strong> is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element. For example, one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room temperature. A gold coin is simply a very large number of gold atoms molded into the shape of a coin and containing small amounts of other elements known as impurities. Gold atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the properties of gold.</p> <p>An atom is composed of two regions: the <strong>nucleus</strong>, which is in the center of the atom and contains protons and neutrons, and the outermost region of the atom which holds its electrons in orbit around the nucleus, as illustrated in Figure 1. Atoms contain protons, electrons, and neutrons, among other subatomic particles. The only exception is hydrogen (H), which is made of one proton and one electron with no neutrons.</p> <div id="attachment_1550" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1550" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02211941/Figure_02_01_01.jpg" alt="This illustration shows that, like planets orbiting the sun, electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom.

Elements, such as helium, depicted here, are made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons located within the nucleus, with electrons in orbitals surrounding the nucleus.</p> </div> <p>Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, about 1.67 × 10<sup>–24</sup> grams. Scientists arbitrarily define this amount of mass as one atomic mass unit (amu) or one Dalton, as shown in&nbsp;Table 1. Although similar in mass, protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge. A <strong>proton</strong> is positively charged whereas a <strong>neutron</strong> is uncharged. Therefore, the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass, but not to its charge. <strong>Electrons</strong> are much smaller in mass than protons, weighing only 9.11 × 10<sup>–28</sup> grams, or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit. Hence, they do not contribute much to an element’s overall atomic mass. Therefore, when considering atomic mass, it is customary to ignore the mass of any electrons and calculate the atom’s mass based on the number of protons and neutrons alone. Although not significant contributors to mass, electrons do contribute greatly to the atom’s charge, as each electron has a negative charge equal to the positive charge of a proton. In uncharged, neutral atoms, the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus. In these atoms, the positive and negative charges cancel each other out, leading to an atom with no net charge.</p> <p>Accounting for the sizes of protons, neutrons, and electrons, most of the volume of an atom—greater than 99 percent—is, in fact, empty space. With all this empty space, one might ask why so-called solid objects do not just pass through one another. The reason they do not is that the electrons that surround all atoms are negatively charged and negative charges repel each other.</p> <table><thead><tr><th colspan="4">Table 1.

The number of protons determines an element’s <strong>atomic number</strong> and is used to distinguish one element from another. The number of neutrons is variable, resulting in isotopes, which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess. Together, the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element’s mass number, as illustrated in Figure 2. Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number. This approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number. Since an element’s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers, scientists also determine the <strong>atomic mass</strong>, which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes. Often, the resulting number contains a fraction. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes, some (the majority) with atomic mass 35 (17 protons and 18 neutrons) and some with atomic mass 37 (17 protons and 20 neutrons).</p> <div class="exercises textbox"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <p>Carbon has an atomic number of six, and two stable isotopes with mass numbers of twelve and thirteen, respectively.

<h2>The Periodic Table of Elements</h2>
<p>The different elements are organized and displayed in the periodic table. Devised by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907) in 1869, the table groups elements that, although unique, share certain chemical properties with other elements. The properties of elements are responsible for their physical state at room temperature: they may be gases, solids, or liquids. Elements also have specific chemical reactivity, the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other.</p>
<p>In the periodic table, shown in Figure 3, the elements are organized and displayed according to their atomic number and are arranged in a series of rows and columns based on shared chemical and physical properties. In addition to providing the atomic number for each element, the periodic table also displays the element’s atomic mass. Looking at carbon, for example, its symbol (C) and name appear, as well as its atomic number of six (in the upper left-hand corner) and its atomic mass of 12.11.</p>
<div id="attachment_1379" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1379" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02173709/table-1024x819.jpg" alt="The periodic table consists of eighteen groups and seven periods. Two additional rows of elements, known as the lanthanides and actinides, are placed beneath the main table. The lanthanides include elements 57 through 71 and belong in period seven between groups three and four. The actinides include elements 89 through 98 and belong in period eight between the same groups. These elements are placed separately to make the table more compact. For each element, the name, atomic symbol, atomic number, and atomic mass are provided. The atomic number is a whole number that represents the number of protons. The atomic mass, which is the average mass of different isotopes, is estimated to two decimal places. For example, hydrogen has the atomic symbol H, the atomic number 1, and an atomic mass of 1.01. The atomic mass is always larger that the atomic number. For most small elements, the atomic mass is approximately double the atomic number as the number of protons and neutrons is about equal. The elements are divided into three categories: metals, nonmetals and metalloids. These form a diagonal line from period two, group thirteen to period seven, group sixteen. All elements to the left of the metalloids are metals, and all elements to the right are nonmetals." width="1024" height="819" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02173709/table-1024x819.jpg 1024w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02173709/table-300x240.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02173709/table-768x614.jpg 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02173709/table-65x52.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02173709/table-225x180.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02173709/table-350x280.jpg 350w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02173709/table.jpg 1042w" />

</div>
<p>The periodic table groups elements according to chemical properties. The differences in chemical reactivity between the elements are based on the number and spatial distribution of an atom’s electrons. Atoms that chemically react and bond to each other form molecules. Molecules are simply two or more atoms chemically bonded together. Logically, when two atoms chemically bond to form a molecule, their electrons, which form the outermost region of each atom, come together first as the atoms form a chemical bond.</p>

<p>It should be stressed that there is a connection between the number of protons in an element, the atomic number that distinguishes one element from another, and the number of electrons it has. In all electrically neutral atoms, the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons. Thus, each element, at least when electrically neutral, has a characteristic number of electrons equal to its atomic number.</p>
<p>An early model of the atom was developed in 1913 by Danish scientist Niels Bohr (1885–1962). In this model, electrons exist within principal shells. An electron normally exists in the lowest energy shell available, which is the one closest to the nucleus. Energy from a photon of light can bump it up to a higher energy shell, but this situation is unstable, and the electron quickly decays back to the ground state. In the process, a photon of light is released.</p>
<p>The Bohr model shows the atom as a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with the electrons in circular <strong>orbitals</strong> at specific distances from the nucleus, as illustrated in Figure 4. These orbits form electron shells or energy levels, which are a way of visualizing the number of electrons in the outermost shells. These energy levels are designated by a number and the symbol “n.” For example, 1n represents the first energy level located closest to the nucleus.</p>
<p>Electrons fill orbitals in a consistent order: they first fill the orbitals closest to the nucleus, then they continue to fill orbitals of increasing energy further from the nucleus. If there are multiple orbitals of equal energy, they will be filled with one electron in each energy level before a second electron is added. The electrons of the outermost energy level determine the energetic stability of the atom and its tendency to form chemical bonds with other atoms to form molecules.</p>
<p>Under standard conditions, atoms fill the inner shells first, often resulting in a variable number of electrons in the outermost shell. The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of eight electrons. This is known as the <strong>octet rule</strong>, which states, with the exception of the innermost shell, that atoms are more stable energetically when they have eight electrons in their <strong>valence shell</strong>, the outermost electron shell. Examples of some neutral atoms and their electron configurations are shown in Figure 5. Notice that in this figure, helium has a complete outer electron shell, with two electrons filling its first and only shell. Similarly, neon has a complete outer 2n shell containing eight electrons. In contrast, chlorine and sodium have seven and one in their outer shells, respectively, but theoretically they would be more energetically stable if they followed the octet rule and had eight.</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bohr diagrams indicate how many electrons fill each principal shell. Group 18 elements (helium, neon, and argon are shown in Figure 5) have a full outer, or valence, shell. A full valence shell is the most stable electron configuration. Elements in other groups have partially filled valence shells and gain or lose electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration.</p>
<p>An atom may give, take, or share electrons with another atom to achieve a full valence shell, the most stable electron configuration. Looking at this figure, how many electrons do elements in group 1 need to lose in order to achieve a stable electron configuration? How many electrons do elements in groups 14 and 17 need to gain to achieve a stable configuration?</p>
<p><textarea rows="2" cols="50"></textarea></p> <div class="qa-wrapper" style="display: block"><span class="show-answer collapsed" style="cursor: pointer" data-target="q766153"><strong>Show Answer</strong></span> <div id="q766153" class="hidden-answer" style="display: none">Elements in group 1 need to lose one electron to achieve a stable electron configuration. Elements in groups 14 and 17 need to gain four and one electrons, respectively, to achieve a stable configuration.</div> </div> </div> <p>Understanding that the organization of the periodic table is based on the total number of protons (and electrons) helps us know how electrons are distributed among the outer shell. The periodic table is arranged in columns and rows based on the number of electrons and where these electrons are located. Take a closer look at the some of the elements in the periodic table’s far right column in Figure&nbsp;3.</p> <p>The group 18 atoms helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar) all have filled outer electron shells, making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability; they are highly stable as single atoms. Their non-reactivity has resulted in their being named the <strong>inert gases</strong> (or <strong>noble gases</strong>). Compare this to the group 1 elements in the left-hand column. These elements, including hydrogen (H), lithium (Li), and sodium (Na), all have one electron in their outermost shells. That means that they can achieve a stable configuration and a filled outer shell by donating or sharing one electron with another atom or a molecule such as water. Hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this configuration, while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become stable. As a result of losing a negatively charged electron, they become positively charged <strong>ions</strong>. Group 17 elements, including fluorine and chlorine, have seven electrons in their outmost shells, so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules, making them negatively charged ions. Group 14 elements, of which carbon is the most important to living systems, have four electrons in their outer shell allowing them to make several covalent bonds (discussed below) with other atoms. Thus, the columns of the periodic table represent the potential shared state of these elements’ outer electron shells that is responsible for their similar chemical characteristics.</p> <h3>Electron Orbitals</h3> <p>Although useful to explain the reactivity and chemical bonding of certain elements, the Bohr model of the atom does not accurately reflect how electrons are spatially distributed surrounding the nucleus. They do not circle the nucleus like the earth orbits the sun, but are found in <strong>electron orbitals</strong>. These relatively complex shapes result from the fact that electrons behave not just like particles, but also like waves. Mathematical equations from quantum mechanics known as wave functions can predict within a certain level of probability where an electron might be at any given time. The area where an electron is most likely to be found is called its orbital.</p> <div id="attachment_1385" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02180414/Figure_02_01_07.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-1385" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02180414/Figure_02_01_07-1024x674.jpg" alt="Illustration shows 1ns, 2ns and 2np subshells.

Click for a larger image. The <em>s</em> subshells are shaped like spheres. Both the 1n and 2n principal shells have an <em>s</em> orbital, but the size of the sphere is larger in the 2n orbital. Each sphere is a single orbital. <em>p</em> subshells are made up of three dumbbell-shaped orbitals. Principal shell 2n has a <em>p</em> subshell, but shell 1 does not.</p> </div> <p>Recall that the Bohr model depicts an atom’s electron shell configuration. Within each electron shell are subshells, and each subshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons. While it is impossible to calculate exactly where an electron is located, scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path. Subshells are designated by the letters <em>s</em>,&nbsp;<em>p</em>, <em>d</em>, and <em>f</em>. The <em>s&nbsp;</em>subshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital. Principal shell 1n has only a single <em>s</em> orbital, which can hold two electrons. Principal shell 2n has one <em>s</em> and one <em>p</em> subshell, and can hold a total of eight electrons. The <em>p</em> subshell has three dumbbell-shaped orbitals, as illustrated in Figure 6. Subshells <em>d</em> and <em>f</em> have more complex shapes and contain five and seven orbitals, respectively. These are not shown in the illustration. Principal shell 3n has <em>s</em>, <em>p</em>, and <em>d</em> subshells and can hold 18 electrons. Principal shell 4n has <em>s</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>d</em> and <em>f&nbsp;</em>orbitals and can hold 32 electrons. Moving away from the nucleus, the number of electrons and orbitals found in the energy levels increases. Progressing from one atom to the next in the periodic table, the electron structure can be worked out by fitting an extra electron into the next available orbital.</p> <p>The closest orbital to the nucleus, called the 1<em>s</em> orbital, can hold up to two electrons. This orbital is equivalent to the innermost electron shell of the Bohr model of the atom. It is called the 1<em>s</em> orbital because it is spherical around the nucleus. The 1<em>s</em> orbital is the closest orbital to the nucleus, and it is always filled first, before any other orbital can be filled. Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it has only one spot within the 1<em>s</em> orbital occupied. This is designated as 1<em>s</em><sup>1</sup>, where the superscripted 1 refers to the one electron within the 1<em>s</em> orbital. Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely fill the 1<em>s</em> orbital with its two electrons. This is designated as 1<em>s</em><sup>2</sup>, referring to the two electrons of helium in the 1<em>s</em> orbital. On the periodic table Figure 6, hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in the first row (period); this is because they only have electrons in their first shell, the 1<em>s</em> orbital. Hydrogen and helium are the only two elements that have the 1<em>s</em> and no other electron orbitals in the electrically neutral state.</p> <p>The second electron shell may contain eight electrons. This shell contains another spherical <em>s</em> orbital and three “dumbbell” shaped <em>p </em>orbitals, each of which can hold two electrons, as shown in Figure 6. After the 1<em>s</em> orbital is filled, the second electron shell is filled, first filling its 2<em>s</em> orbital and then its three <em>p</em> orbitals. When filling the <em>p</em> orbitals, each takes a single electron; once each <em>p</em> orbital has an electron, a second may be added. Lithium (Li) contains three electrons that occupy the first and second shells. Two electrons fill the 1<em>s</em> orbital, and the third electron then fills the 2<em>s</em> orbital. Its <strong>electron configuration</strong> is 1<em>s</em><sup>2</sup>2<em>s</em><sup>1</sup>. Neon (Ne), on the other hand, has a total of ten electrons: two are in its innermost 1<em>s</em> orbital and eight fill its second shell (two each in the 2<em>s</em> and three <em>p</em> orbitals); thus, it is an inert gas and energetically stable as a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other atoms. Larger elements have additional orbitals, making up the third electron shell. While the concepts of electron shells and orbitals are closely related, orbitals provide a more accurate depiction of the electron configuration of an atom because the orbital model specifies the different shapes and special orientations of all the places that electrons may occupy.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p>Watch&nbsp;this visual animation to see the spatial arrangement of the <em>p</em> and <em>s</em> orbitals.

This fills their outermost electron shell and makes them energetically more stable. Because the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons, each ion has a net charge.&nbsp;<strong>Cations</strong> are positive ions that are formed by losing electrons. Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions. <strong>Anions</strong> are designated by their elemental name being altered to end in “-ide”: the anion of chlorine is called chloride, and the anion of sulfur is called sulfide, for example.</p> <p>This movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as&nbsp;<strong>electron transfer</strong>. As&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;1 illustrates, sodium (Na) only has one electron in its outer electron shell. It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one electron than it does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. If sodium loses an electron, it now has 11 protons, 11 neutrons, and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. It is now referred to as a sodium ion. Chlorine (Cl) in its lowest energy state (called the ground state) has seven electrons in its outer shell. Again, it is more energy-efficient for chlorine to gain one electron than to lose seven. Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons, 17 neutrons, and 18 electrons, giving it a net negative (–1) charge. It is now referred to as a chloride ion. In this example, sodium will donate its one electron to empty its shell, and chlorine will accept that electron to fill its shell. Both ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete outermost shells. Because the number of electrons is no longer equal to the number of protons, each is now an ion and has a +1 (sodium cation) or –1 (chloride anion) charge. Note that these transactions can normally only take place simultaneously: in order for a sodium atom to lose an electron, it must be in the presence of a suitable recipient like a chlorine atom.</p> <div id="attachment_1546" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1546" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02211747/Figure_02_01_10.jpg" alt="A sodium and a chlorine atom sit side by side.

These bonds are stronger and much more common than ionic bonds in the molecules of living organisms. Covalent bonds are commonly found in carbon-based organic molecules, such as our DNA and proteins. Covalent bonds are also found in inorganic molecules like H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub>. One, two, or three pairs of electrons may be shared, making single, double, and triple bonds, respectively. The more covalent bonds between two atoms, the stronger their connection. Thus, triple bonds are the strongest.</p> <p>The strength of different levels of covalent bonding is one of the main reasons living organisms have a difficult time in acquiring nitrogen for use in constructing their molecules, even though molecular nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>, is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere. Molecular nitrogen consists of two nitrogen atoms triple bonded to each other and, as with all molecules, the sharing of these three pairs of electrons between the two nitrogen atoms allows for the filling of their outer electron shells, making the molecule more stable than the individual nitrogen atoms. This strong triple bond makes it difficult for living systems to break apart this nitrogen in order to use it as constituents of proteins and DNA.</p> <p>The formation of water molecules provides an example of covalent bonding. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine to form water molecules are bound together by covalent bonds. The electron from the hydrogen splits its time between the incomplete outer shell of the hydrogen atoms and the incomplete outer shell of the oxygen atoms. To completely fill the outer shell of oxygen, which has six electrons in its outer shell but which would be more stable with eight, two electrons (one from each hydrogen atom) are needed: hence the well-known formula H<sub>2</sub>O. The electrons are shared between the two elements to fill the outer shell of each, making both elements more stable.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p>View&nbsp;this short video to see an animation of ionic and covalent bonding.</p> <p><script type="text/javascript" src="//static.3playmedia.com/p/projects/20361/files/1280791/plugins/11085.js"></script><script src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api" type="text/javascript"></script><br /> </p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

In a&nbsp;<strong>polar covalent bond</strong>, shown in&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;2, the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other. Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements, a slightly positive (<em>δ</em>+) or slightly negative (<em>δ</em>–) charge develops. This partial charge is an important property of water and accounts for many of its characteristics.</p> <p>Water is a polar molecule, with the hydrogen atoms acquiring a partial positive charge and the oxygen a partial negative charge. This occurs because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more attractive to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms than the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygen’s electrons. Thus oxygen has a higher <strong>electronegativity</strong> than hydrogen and the shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms, giving the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges, respectively. Another way of stating this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus. Either way, the atom’s relative electronegativity contributes to the development of partial charges whenever one element is significantly more electronegative than the other, and the charges generated by these polar bonds may then be used for the formation of hydrogen bonds based on the attraction of opposite partial charges. (Hydrogen bonds, which are discussed in detail below, are weak bonds between slightly positively charged hydrogen atoms to slightly negatively charged atoms in other molecules.) Since macromolecules often have atoms within them that differ in electronegativity, polar bonds are often present in organic molecules.</p> <h3>Nonpolar Covalent Bonds</h3> <div id="attachment_1548" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1548" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02211833/Figure_02_01_11.jpg" alt="Table compares water, methane and carbon dioxide molecules. In water, oxygen has a stronger pull on electrons than hydrogen resulting in a polar covalent O-H bond. Likewise in carbon dioxide the oxygen has a stronger pull on electrons than carbon and the bond is polar covalent. However, water has a bent shape because two lone pairs of electrons push the hydrogen atoms together so the molecule is polar. By contrast carbon dioxide has two double bonds that repel each other, resulting in a linear shape. The polar bonds in carbon dioxide cancel each other out, resulting in a nonpolar molecule. In methane, the bond between carbon and hydrogen is nonpolar and the molecule is a symmetrical tetrahedron with hydrogens spaced as far apart as possible on the three-dimensional sphere. Since methane is symmetrical with nonpolar bonds, it is a nonpolar molecule." width="800" height="675" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02211833/Figure_02_01_11.jpg 800w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02211833/Figure_02_01_11-300x253.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02211833/Figure_02_01_11-768x648.jpg 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02211833/Figure_02_01_11-65x55.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02211833/Figure_02_01_11-225x190.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02211833/Figure_02_01_11-350x295.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure&nbsp;2. Whether a molecule is polar or nonpolar depends both on bond type and molecular shape. Both water and carbon dioxide have polar covalent bonds, but carbon dioxide is linear, so the partial charges on the molecule cancel each other out.</p> </div> <p><strong>Nonpolar covalent bonds</strong> form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons equally. For example, molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between the two oxygen atoms.</p> <p>Another example of a nonpolar covalent bond is methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), also shown in&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;2. Carbon has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs four more to fill it. It gets these four from four hydrogen atoms, each atom providing one, making a stable outer shell of eight electrons. Carbon and hydrogen do not have the same electronegativity but are similar; thus, nonpolar bonds form. The hydrogen atoms each need one electron for their outermost shell, which is filled when it contains two electrons. These elements share the electrons equally among the carbons and the hydrogen atoms, creating a nonpolar covalent molecule.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p>Watch this video for another explanation of covalent bonds and how they form:</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mo4Vfqt5v2A/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &quot;Covalent Bonding&quot;" title="Covalent Bonding" /> <p>A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Iconic bonds are not as strong as covalent, which determines their behavior in biological systems. However, not all bonds are ionic or covalent bonds. Weaker bonds can also form between molecules. Two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. Without these two types of bonds, life as we know it would not exist. Hydrogen bonds provide many of the critical, life-sustaining properties of water and also stabilize the structures of proteins and DNA, the building block of cells.</p> <p>When polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form, the hydrogen in that bond has a slightly positive charge because hydrogen’s electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen. Because the hydrogen is slightly positive, it will be attracted to neighboring negative charges. When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the&nbsp;<em>δ</em>+ of the hydrogen from one molecule and the <em>δ</em>– charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule, usually oxygen or nitrogen, or within the same molecule. This interaction is called a <strong>hydrogen bond</strong>. This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules. Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken; however, they occur in very large numbers in water and in organic polymers, creating a major force in combination. Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the DNA double helix.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iOOvX0jmhJ4/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &quot;Water: A Polar Molecule&quot;" title="Water: A Polar Molecule" /> <p>A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

It can stand in for an infinite variety of molecules.</div> <p>Functional groups are found along the “carbon backbone” of macromolecules which is formed by chains and/or rings of carbon atoms with the occasional substitution of an element such as nitrogen or oxygen. Molecules with other elements in their carbon backbone are substituted hydrocarbons. Each of the four types of macromolecules—proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids—has its own characteristic set of functional groups that contributes greatly to its differing chemical properties and its function in living organisms.</p> <h2>Properties of Functional Groups</h2> <p>A functional group can participate in specific chemical reactions. Some of the important functional groups in biological molecules include: hydroxyl, methyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate, and sulfhydryl groups. These groups play an important role in the formation of molecules like DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids.</p> <h2>Classifying Functional Groups</h2> <p>Functional groups are usually classified as hydrophobic or hydrophilic depending on their charge or polarity. An example of a hydrophobic group is the non-polar methane molecule. Among the hydrophilic functional groups is the carboxyl group found in amino acids, some amino acid side chains, and the fatty acid heads that form triglycerides and phospholipids. This carboxyl group ionizes to release hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) from the —COOH group resulting in the negatively charged —COO<sup>–</sup> group; this contributes to the hydrophilic nature of whatever molecule it is found on. Other functional groups, such as the carbonyl group, have a partially negatively charged oxygen atom that may form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, again making the molecule more hydrophilic.</p> <table><thead><tr><th colspan="4">Table 1.

You might have even used some to test whether the water in a swimming pool is properly treated. In both cases, the pH test measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in a given solution.</p> <p>Hydrogen ions are spontaneously generated in pure water by the dissociation (ionization) of a small percentage of water molecules into equal numbers of hydrogen (H<sup>+</sup>) ions and hydroxide (OH<sup>–</sup>) ions. While the hydroxide ions are kept in solution by their hydrogen bonding with other water molecules, the hydrogen ions, consisting of naked protons, are immediately attracted to un-ionized water molecules, forming hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>). Still, by convention, scientists refer to hydrogen ions and their concentration as if they were free in this state in liquid water.</p> <p>The concentration of hydrogen ions dissociating from pure water is 1 × 10<sup>–7</sup> moles H<sup>+</sup> ions per liter of water. Moles (mol) are a way to express the amount of a substance (which can be atoms, molecules, ions, etc), with one mole being equal to 6.02 x 1023 particles of the substance. Therefore, 1 mole of water is equal to 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> water molecules. The pH is calculated as the negative of the base 10 logarithm of this concentration. The log10 of 1 × 10<sup>–7</sup> is –7.0, and the negative of this number (indicated by the “p” of “pH”) yields a pH of 7.0, which is also known as neutral pH. The pH inside of human cells and blood are examples of two areas of the body where near-neutral pH is maintained.</p> <p>Non-neutral pH readings result from dissolving acids or bases in water. Using the negative logarithm to generate positive integers, high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH number, whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH. An&nbsp;<strong>acid</strong> is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) in a solution, usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate. A <strong>base</strong> provides either hydroxide ions (OH<sup>–</sup>) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions, reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH. In cases where the base releases hydroxide ions, these ions bind to free hydrogen ions, generating new water molecules.</p> <div id="attachment_1541" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1541" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02211419/Figure_02_02_07-e1462223694258.jpg" alt="The pH scale, which ranges from zero to 14, sits next to a bar with the colors of the rainbow.

The pH scale measures the concentration of hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) in a solution.</p> </div> <p>The stronger the acid, the more readily it donates H<sup>+</sup>. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) completely dissociates into hydrogen and chloride ions and is highly acidic, whereas the acids in tomato juice or vinegar do not completely dissociate and are considered weak acids.</p> <p>Conversely, strong bases are those substances that readily donate OH<sup>–</sup> or take up hydrogen ions. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and many household cleaners are highly alkaline and give up OH<sup>–</sup> rapidly when placed in water, thereby raising the pH. An example of a weak basic solution is seawater, which has a pH near 8.0, close enough to neutral pH that marine organisms adapted to this saline environment are able to thrive in&nbsp;it.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<strong>pH scale</strong> is, as previously mentioned, an inverse logarithm and ranges from 0 to 14 (Figure&nbsp;1). Anything below 7.0 (ranging from 0.0 to 6.9) is acidic, and anything above 7.0 (from 7.1 to 14.0) is alkaline. Extremes in pH in either direction from 7.0 are usually considered inhospitable to life. The pH inside cells (6.8) and the pH in the blood (7.4) are both very close to neutral.</p> <p>However, the environment in the stomach is highly acidic, with a pH of 1 to 2. So how do the cells of the stomach survive in such an acidic environment? How do they homeostatically maintain the near neutral pH inside them? The answer is that they cannot do it and are constantly dying. New stomach cells are constantly produced to replace dead ones, which are digested by the stomach acids. It is estimated that the lining of the human stomach is completely replaced every seven to ten days.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p>Watch&nbsp;this video for a straightforward explanation of pH and its logarithmic scale.</p> <p><script type="text/javascript" src="//static.3playmedia.com/p/projects/20361/files/1280799/plugins/11085.js"></script><script src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api" type="text/javascript"></script><br /> </p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Buffers readily absorb excess H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>–</sup>, keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival. Maintaining a constant blood pH is critical to a person’s well-being. The buffer maintaining the pH of human blood involves carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), bicarbonate ion (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>), and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). When bicarbonate ions combine with free hydrogen ions and become carbonic acid, hydrogen ions are removed, moderating pH changes. Similarly, as shown in Figure 2, excess carbonic acid can be converted to carbon dioxide gas and exhaled through the lungs. This prevents too many free hydrogen ions from building up in the blood and dangerously reducing the blood’s pH. Likewise, if too much OH<sup>–</sup> is introduced into the system, carbonic acid will combine with it to create bicarbonate, lowering the pH. Without this buffer system, the body’s pH would fluctuate enough to put survival in jeopardy.</p> <div id="attachment_1543" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1543" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02211648/Figure_02_02_08.jpg" alt="An H2O molecule can combine with a CO2 molecule to form H2CO3, or carbonic acid.

Many of these over-the-counter medications work in the same way as blood buffers, usually with at least one ion capable of absorbing hydrogen and moderating pH, bringing relief to those that suffer “heartburn” after eating. The unique properties of water that contribute to this capacity to balance pH—as well as water’s other characteristics—are essential to sustaining life on Earth.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>In Summary: Buffers</h3> <p>The pH scale is a measure of acidity/alkalinity and provides information about how substances tend to act in aqueous solutions.

The oxygen atoms in an O<sub>2</sub> molecule are joined by a double bond.</p> </div> <p>Some chemical reactions, such as the one shown above, can proceed in one direction until the reactants are all used up. The equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are&nbsp;<strong>irreversible</strong>. <strong>Reversible reactions</strong> are those that can go in either direction. In reversible reactions, reactants are turned into products, but when the concentration of product goes beyond a certain threshold (characteristic of the particular reaction), some of these products will be converted back into reactants; at this point, the designations of products and reactants are reversed. This back and forth continues until a certain relative balance between reactants and products occurs—a state called <strong>equilibrium</strong>. These situations of reversible reactions are often denoted by a chemical equation with a double headed arrow pointing towards both the reactants and products.</p> <p>For example, in human blood, excess hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) bind to bicarbonate ions (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>) forming an equilibrium state with carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). If carbonic acid were added to this system, some of it would be converted to bicarbonate and hydrogen ions.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>&nbsp;+ H<sup>+</sup> ↔&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub></p> <p>In biological reactions, however, equilibrium is rarely obtained because the concentrations of the reactants or products or both are constantly changing, often with a product of one reaction being a reactant for another. To return to the example of excess hydrogen ions in the blood, the formation of carbonic acid will be the major direction of the reaction. However, the carbonic acid can also leave the body as carbon dioxide gas (via exhalation) instead of being converted back to bicarbonate ion, thus driving the reaction to the right by the chemical law known as&nbsp;<strong>law of mass action</strong>. These reactions are important for maintaining the homeostasis of our blood.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">CO<sub>3</sub> ↔ CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O</p> <h2>Anabolic and Catabolic Pathways</h2> <p>Anabolic pathways require an input of energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones. Synthesizing sugar from CO<sub>2</sub> is one example. Other examples are the synthesis of large proteins from amino acid building blocks, and the synthesis of new DNA strands from nucleic acid building blocks. These biosynthetic processes are critical to the life of the cell, take place constantly, and demand energy provided by ATP and other high-energy molecules like NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADPH (Figure 3).</p> <p>ATP is an important molecule for cells to have in sufficient supply at all times. The breakdown of sugars illustrates how a single molecule of glucose can store enough energy to make a great deal of ATP, 36 to 38 molecules. This is a catabolic pathway. Catabolic pathways involve the degradation (or breakdown) of complex molecules into simpler ones. Molecular energy stored in the bonds of complex molecules is released in catabolic pathways and harvested in such a way that it can be used to produce ATP. Other energy-storing molecules, such as fats, are also broken down through similar catabolic reactions to release energy and make ATP (Figure 3).</p> <div id="attachment_1662" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1662" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02235219/Figure_06_01_03.jpg" alt="Anabolic and catabolic pathways are shown.

Each reaction step is facilitated, or catalyzed, by a protein called an enzyme.

Many enzyme names end with –<em>ase</em>. For example, the enzyme lactase is used to break down the sugar lactose, found in mammalian milk. Other enzymes are known by a common name, such as pepsin, which is an enzyme that aids in the digestion of proteins in your stomach by breaking the peptide bonds in the proteins.</p> <p>Enzymes are catalysts, meaning that they make a reaction go faster, but the enzymes themselves are not altered by the overall reaction.

If the activation energy is large, then the reaction will take longer to occur. Enzymes function to reduce the activation energy required for a chemical reaction to occur.</p> <p>First, the enzyme binds to the substrate and slightly distorts its shape. The change in shape activates the substrate molecule and decreases the total activation energy required for the substrate to be turned into product. As the number of activated substrate molecules increases, so does the conversion of substrate to product. An analogy for this effect is a ski hill, with skiers at the bottom of one side of the hill representing substrates, skiers on the top of the hill representing activated substrates, and the products being the number of skiers that ski down the other side.

The matter and its environment relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system, and everything outside of that system is called the surroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and the water. Energy is transferred within the system (between the stove, pot, and water). There are two types of systems: open and closed. An open system is one in which energy can be transferred between the system and its surroundings. The stovetop system is open because heat can be lost into the air. A closed system is one that cannot transfer energy to its surroundings.</p> <p>Biological organisms are open systems. Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings, as they consume energy-storing molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work. Like all things in the physical world, energy is subject to the laws of physics. The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the universe.</p> <p>In studying energy, scientists use the term “system” to refer to the matter and its environment involved in energy transfers. Everything outside of the system is called the surroundings. Single cells are biological systems. Systems can be thought of as having a certain amount of order. It takes energy to make a system more ordered. The more ordered a system is, the lower its entropy. Entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. As a system becomes more disordered, the lower its energy and the higher its entropy become.</p> <h2>The First Law of Thermodynamics</h2> <p>The first law of thermodynamics deals with the total amount of energy in the universe. It states that this total amount of energy is constant. In other words, there has always been, and always will be, exactly the same amount of energy in the universe. Energy exists in many different forms. According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy may be transferred from place to place or transformed into different forms, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The transfers and transformations of energy take place around us all the time. Light bulbs transform electrical energy into light energy. Gas stoves transform chemical energy from natural gas into heat energy.

Sharon Pruitt; credit “kids on bikes”: modification of work by Michelle Riggen-Ransom; credit “leaf”: modification of work by Cory Zanker)</p> </div> <p>The challenge for all living organisms is to obtain energy from their surroundings in forms that they can transfer or transform into usable energy to do work. Living cells have evolved to meet this challenge very well. Chemical energy stored within organic molecules such as sugars and fats is transformed through a series of cellular chemical reactions into energy within molecules of ATP. Energy in ATP molecules is easily accessible to do work. Examples of the types of work that cells need to do include building complex molecules, transporting materials, powering the beating motion of cilia or flagella, contracting muscle fibers to create movement, and reproduction.</p> <h2>The Second Law of Thermodynamics</h2> <p>A living cell’s primary tasks of obtaining, transforming, and using energy to do work may seem simple. However, the second law of thermodynamics explains why these tasks are harder than they appear. None of the energy transfers we’ve discussed, along with all energy transfers and transformations in the universe, is completely efficient. In every energy transfer, some amount of energy is lost in a form that is unusable. In most cases, this form is heat energy. Thermodynamically, heat energy is defined as the energy transferred from one system to another that is not doing work. For example, when an airplane flies through the air, some of the energy of the flying plane is lost as heat energy due to friction with the surrounding air. This friction actually heats the air by temporarily increasing the speed of air molecules. Likewise, some energy is lost as heat energy during cellular metabolic reactions. This is good for warm-blooded creatures like us, because heat energy helps to maintain our body temperature. Strictly speaking, no energy transfer is completely efficient, because some energy is lost in an unusable form.</p> <div id="attachment_1535" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1535" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02205556/Figure_06_02_02.jpg" alt="This diagram shows that solids have a regular packing arrangement and low entropy, whereas liquids have irregular packing and higher entropy." width="400" height="363" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02205556/Figure_06_02_02.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02205556/Figure_06_02_02-300x272.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02205556/Figure_06_02_02-65x59.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02205556/Figure_06_02_02-225x204.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02205556/Figure_06_02_02-350x317.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2. Entropy is a measure of randomness or disorder in a system. Gases have higher entropy than liquids, and liquids have higher entropy than solids.</p> </div> <p>An important concept in physical systems is that of order and disorder (also known as randomness). The more energy that is lost by a system to its surroundings, the less ordered and more random the system is. Scientists refer to the measure of randomness or disorder within a system as entropy. High entropy means high disorder and low energy (Figure 2). To better understand entropy, think of a student’s bedroom. If no energy or work were put into it, the room would quickly become messy. It would exist in a very disordered state, one of high entropy. Energy must be put into the system, in the form of the student doing work and putting everything away, in order to bring the room back to a state of cleanliness and order. This state is one of low entropy. Similarly, a car or house must be constantly maintained with work in order to keep it in an ordered state. Left alone, the entropy of the house or car gradually increases through rust and degradation. Molecules and chemical reactions have varying amounts of entropy as well. For example, as chemical reactions reach a state of equilibrium, entropy increases, and as molecules at a high concentration in one place diffuse and spread out, entropy also increases.</p> <div class="textbox examples"><h3>Try It Yourself</h3> <p>Set up a simple experiment to understand how energy is transferred and how a change in entropy results.</p> <ol><li>Take a block of ice. This is water in solid form, so it has a high structural order. This means that the molecules cannot move very much and are in a fixed position. The temperature of the ice is 0°C. As a result, the entropy of the system is low.</li> <li>Allow the ice to melt at room temperature. What is the state of molecules in the liquid water now? How did the energy transfer take place? Is the entropy of the system higher or lower? Why?</li> <li>Heat the water to its boiling point. What happens to the entropy of the system when the water is heated?</li> </ol> </div> <p>All physical systems can be thought of in this way: Living things are highly ordered, requiring constant energy input to be maintained in a state of low entropy. As living systems take in energy-storing molecules and transform them through chemical reactions, they lose some amount of usable energy in the process, because no reaction is completely efficient. They also produce waste and by-products that aren’t useful energy sources. This process increases the entropy of the system’s surroundings. Since all energy transfers result in the loss of some usable energy, the second law of thermodynamics states that every energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe. Even though living things are highly ordered and maintain a state of low entropy, the entropy of the universe in total is constantly increasing due to the loss of usable energy with each energy transfer that occurs. Essentially, living things are in a continuous uphill battle against this constant increase in universal entropy.</p> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

In membrane proteins, nonpolar and hydrophobic amino acid side chains associate with the hydrophobic tails of phospholipids, while polar and charged amino acid side chains interact with the polar head groups or with the aqueous solution. However, there are exceptions. Sometimes, positively and negatively charged amino acid side chains interact with one another in the interior of a protein, and polar or charged amino acid side chains that interact with a ligand can be found in the ligand binding pocket.</div> </div> </div> <p>The chemical nature of the side chain determines the nature of the amino acid (that is, whether it is acidic, basic, polar, or nonpolar). For example, the amino acid glycine has a hydrogen atom as the R group. Amino acids such as valine, methionine, and alanine are nonpolar or hydrophobic in nature, while amino acids such as serine, threonine, and cysteine are polar and have hydrophilic side chains. The side chains of lysine and arginine are positively charged, and therefore these amino acids are also known as basic amino acids. Proline has an R group that is linked to the amino group, forming a ring-like structure. Proline is an exception to the standard structure of an animo acid since its amino group is not separate from the side chain (Figure&nbsp;2).</p> <p>Amino acids are represented by a single upper case letter or a three-letter abbreviation. For example, valine is known by the letter V or the three-letter symbol val. Just as some fatty acids are essential to a diet, some amino acids are necessary as well. They are known as essential amino acids, and in humans they include isoleucine, leucine, and cysteine. Essential amino acids refer to those necessary for construction of proteins in the body, although not produced by the body; which amino acids are essential varies from organism to organism.</p> <div id="attachment_1567" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1567" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02220523/Figure_03_04_03-300x216.jpg" alt="The formation of a peptide bond between two amino acids is shown.

Peptide bond formation is a dehydration synthesis reaction. The carboxyl group of one amino acid is linked to the amino group of the incoming amino acid. In the process, a molecule of water is released.</p> </div> <p>The sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine the protein’s shape, size, and function. Each amino acid is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond, known as a peptide bond, which is formed by a dehydration reaction. The carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the incoming amino acid combine, releasing a molecule of water. The resulting bond is the peptide bond (Figure&nbsp;3).</p> <p>The products formed by such linkages are called peptides. As more amino acids join to this growing chain, the resulting chain is known as a polypeptide. Each polypeptide has a free amino group at one end. This end is called the N terminal, or the amino terminal, and the other end has a free carboxyl group, also known as the C or carboxyl terminal. While the terms polypeptide and protein are sometimes used interchangeably, a polypeptide is technically a polymer of amino acids, whereas the term protein is used for a polypeptide or polypeptides that have combined together, often have bound non-peptide prosthetic groups, have a distinct shape, and have a unique function. After protein synthesis (translation), most proteins are modified. These are known as post-translational modifications. They may undergo cleavage, phosphorylation, or may require the addition of other chemical groups. Only after these modifications is the protein completely functional.</p> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>The Evolutionary Significance of Cytochrome&nbsp;c</h3> <p>Cytochrome&nbsp;c is an important component of the electron transport chain, a part of cellular respiration, and it is normally found in the cellular organelle, the mitochondrion. This protein has a heme prosthetic group, and the central ion of the heme gets alternately reduced and oxidized during electron transfer. Because this essential protein’s role in producing cellular energy is crucial, it has changed very little over millions of years. Protein sequencing has shown that there is a considerable amount of cytochrome&nbsp;c amino acid sequence homology among different species; in other words, evolutionary kinship can be assessed by measuring the similarities or differences among various species’ DNA or protein sequences.</p> <p>Scientists have determined that human cytochrome&nbsp;c contains 104 amino acids. For each cytochrome&nbsp;c molecule from different organisms that has been sequenced to date, 37 of these amino acids appear in the same position in all samples of cytochrome&nbsp;c. This indicates that there may have been a common ancestor. On comparing the human and chimpanzee protein sequences, no sequence difference was found. When human and rhesus monkey sequences were compared, the single difference found was in one amino acid. In another comparison, human to yeast sequencing shows a difference in the 44th position.</p> </div> <h2>Protein Structure</h2> <p>As discussed earlier, the shape of a protein is critical to its function. For example, an enzyme can bind to a specific substrate at a site known as the active site. If this active site is altered because of local changes or changes in overall protein structure, the enzyme may be unable to bind to the substrate. To understand how the protein gets its final shape or conformation, we need to understand the four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.</p> <h3>Primary Structure</h3> <p>The unique sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure. For example, the pancreatic hormone insulin has two polypeptide chains, A and B, and they are linked together by disulfide bonds. The N terminal amino acid of the A chain is glycine, whereas the C terminal amino acid is asparagine (Figure 4). The sequences of amino acids in the A and B chains are unique to insulin.</p> <div id="attachment_1569" style="width: 1127px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1569 size-full" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02220728/Figure_03_04_04.jpg" alt="The amino acid sequences for the A chain and B chain of bovine insulin are shown.

The amino acid cysteine (cys) has a sulfhydryl (SH) group as a side chain. Two sulfhydryl groups can react in the presence of oxygen to form a disulfide (S-S) bond.

The <em>α</em>-helix and <em>β</em>-pleated sheet structures are found in most globular and fibrous proteins and they play an important structural role.</p> <h3>Tertiary Structure</h3> <p>The unique three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is its tertiary structure (Figure 8). This structure is in part due to chemical interactions at work on the polypeptide chain. Primarily, the interactions among R groups creates the complex three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein. The nature of the R groups found in the amino acids involved can counteract the formation of the hydrogen bonds described for standard secondary structures. For example, R groups with like charges are repelled by each other and those with unlike charges are attracted to each other (ionic bonds). When protein folding takes place, the hydrophobic R groups of nonpolar amino acids lay in the interior of the protein, whereas the hydrophilic R groups lay on the outside. The former types of interactions are also known as hydrophobic interactions.

Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure. For example, insulin (a globular protein) has a combination of hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds that cause it to be mostly clumped into a ball shape. Insulin starts out as a single polypeptide and loses some internal sequences in the presence of post-translational modification after the formation of the disulfide linkages that hold the remaining chains together.

If the protein is subject to changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its shape without losing its primary sequence in what is known as denaturation. Denaturation is often reversible because the primary structure of the polypeptide is conserved in the process if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to resume its function. Sometimes denaturation is irreversible, leading to loss of function. One example of irreversible protein denaturation is when an egg is fried. The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan. Not all proteins are denatured at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that function at temperatures close to boiling. The stomach is also very acidic, has a low pH, and denatures proteins as part of the digestion process; however, the digestive enzymes of the stomach retain their activity under these conditions.</p> <p>Protein folding is critical to its function. It was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process. Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers known as chaperones (or chaperonins) that associate with the target protein during the folding process. They act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure, and they disassociate from the protein once the target protein is folded.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">For an additional perspective on proteins, view&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wisc-online.com/learn/natural-science/life-science/ap13304/biomolecules---the-proteins" target="_blank">this animation called “Biomolecules: The Proteins.”</a></div> <h2>Function of Proteins</h2> <p>The primary types and functions of proteins are listed in Table 1.</p> <table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Table 1.

Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) it acts on. The enzyme may help in breakdown, rearrangement, or synthesis reactions. Enzymes that break down their substrates are called catabolic enzymes, enzymes that build more complex molecules from their substrates are called anabolic enzymes, and enzymes that affect the rate of reaction are called catalytic enzymes. It should be noted that all enzymes increase the rate of reaction and, therefore, are considered to be organic catalysts. An example of an enzyme is salivary amylase, which hydrolyzes its substrate amylose, a component of starch.</p> <p><strong>Hormones</strong> are chemical-signaling molecules, usually small proteins or steroids, secreted by endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes, including growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction. For example, insulin is a protein hormone that helps to regulate the blood glucose level.</p> <p>Proteins have different shapes and molecular weights; some proteins are globular in shape whereas others are fibrous in nature. For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our skin, is a fibrous protein. Protein shape is critical to its function, and this shape is maintained by many different types of chemical bonds. Changes in temperature, pH, and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape of the protein, leading to loss of function, known as denaturation. All proteins are made up of different arrangements of the same 20 types of amino acids.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>In Summary: Proteins</h3> <p>Proteins are a class of macromolecules that perform a diverse range of functions for the cell. They help in metabolism by providing structural support and by acting as enzymes, carriers, or hormones. The building blocks of proteins (monomers) are amino acids. Each amino acid has a central carbon that is linked to an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and an R group or side chain. There are 20 commonly occurring amino acids, each of which differs in the R group. Each amino acid is linked to its neighbors by a peptide bond. A long chain of amino acids is known as a polypeptide.</p> <p>Proteins are organized at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and (optional) quaternary. The primary structure is the unique sequence of amino acids. The local folding of the polypeptide to form structures such as the&nbsp;<em>α</em> helix and <em>β</em>-pleated sheet constitutes the secondary structure. The overall three-dimensional structure is the tertiary structure. When two or more polypeptides combine to form the complete protein structure, the configuration is known as the quaternary structure of a protein. Protein shape and function are intricately linked; any change in shape caused by changes in temperature or pH may lead to protein denaturation and a loss in function.</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

Hydrophobic lipids in the fur of aquatic mammals, such as this river otter, protect them from the elements. (credit: Ken Bosma)</p> </div> <p>Lipids include a diverse group of compounds that are largely nonpolar in nature. This is because they are hydrocarbons that include mostly nonpolar carbon–carbon or carbon–hydrogen bonds. Non-polar molecules are hydrophobic (“water fearing”), or insoluble in water. Lipids perform many different functions in a cell. Cells store energy for long-term use in the form of fats. Lipids also provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals (Figure 1). For example, they help keep aquatic birds and mammals dry when forming a protective layer over fur or feathers because of their water-repellant hydrophobic nature. Lipids are also the building blocks of many hormones and are an important constituent of all cellular membranes. Lipids include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids.</p> <h2>Fats and Oils</h2> <p>A fat molecule consists of two main components—glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol is an organic compound (alcohol) with three carbons, five hydrogens, and three hydroxyl (OH) groups. Fatty acids have a long chain of hydrocarbons to which a carboxyl group is attached, hence the name “fatty acid.” The number of carbons in the fatty acid may range from 4 to 36; most common are those containing 12–18 carbons. In a fat molecule, the fatty acids are attached to each of the three carbons of the glycerol molecule with an ester bond through an oxygen atom (Figure 2).</p> <div id="attachment_1578" style="width: 786px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1578" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02223150/Figure_03_03_02-776x1024.jpg" alt="The structures of glycerol, a fatty acid, and a triacylglycerol are shown.

Triacylglycerol is formed by the joining of three fatty acids to a glycerol backbone in a dehydration reaction.

The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar. Fats are also called&nbsp;<strong>triacylglycerols</strong> or <strong>triglycerides</strong> because of their chemical structure. Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a <strong>saturated fatty acid</strong>, is derived from the palm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from <em>Arachis hypogea,</em> the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts.</p> <p>Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated.

A fat may contain similar or different fatty acids attached to glycerol. Long straight fatty acids with single bonds tend to get packed tightly and are solid at room temperature. Animal fats with stearic acid and palmitic acid (common in meat) and the fat with butyric acid (common in butter) are examples of saturated fats. Mammals store fats in specialized cells called adipocytes, where globules of fat occupy most of the cell’s volume. In plants, fat or oil is stored in many seeds and is used as a source of energy during seedling development. Unsaturated fats or oils are usually of plant origin and contain&nbsp;<em>cis</em> unsaturated fatty acids. <em>Cis</em> and <em>trans&nbsp;</em>indicate the configuration of the molecule around the double bond. If hydrogens are present in the same plane, it is referred to as a cis fat; if the hydrogen atoms are on two different planes, it is referred to as a trans fat. The <em>cis</em> double bond causes a bend or a “kink” that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly, keeping them liquid at room temperature (Figure 5). Olive oil, corn oil, canola oil, and cod liver oil are examples of unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats help to lower blood cholesterol levels whereas saturated fats contribute to plaque formation in the arteries.</p> <div id="attachment_1581" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1581" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02223537/Figure_03_03_05.jpg" alt="A comparison of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids is shown.

Recent studies have shown that an increase in <em>trans</em> fats in the human diet may lead to an increase in levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or “bad” cholesterol, which in turn may lead to plaque deposition in the arteries, resulting in heart disease. Many fast food restaurants have recently banned the use of <em>trans</em> fats, and food labels are required to display the <em>trans</em> fat content.</p> <h3>Omega Fatty Acids</h3> <div id="attachment_1582" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1582" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02223647/Figure_03_03_07.jpg" alt="The molecular structures of alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid is shown.

Each singly bonded carbon has two hydrogens associated with it, also not shown.</p> </div> <p>Essential fatty acids are fatty acids required but not synthesized by the human body. Consequently, they have to be supplemented through ingestion via the diet. Omega-3 fatty acids (like that shown in Figure 6) fall into this category and are one of only two known for humans (the other being omega-6 fatty acid). These are polyunsaturated fatty acids and are called omega-3 because the third carbon from the end of the hydrocarbon chain is connected to its neighboring carbon by a double bond.</p> <p>The farthest carbon away from the carboxyl group is numbered as the omega (<em>ω</em>) carbon, and if the double bond is between the third and fourth carbon from that end, it is known as an omega-3 fatty acid. Nutritionally important because the body does not make them, omega-3 fatty acids include alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), all of which are polyunsaturated. Salmon, trout, and tuna are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Research indicates that omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of sudden death from heart attacks, reduce triglycerides in the blood, lower blood pressure, and prevent thrombosis by inhibiting blood clotting. They also reduce inflammation, and may help reduce the risk of some cancers in animals.</p> <p>Like carbohydrates, fats have received a lot of bad publicity. It is true that eating an excess of fried foods and other “fatty” foods leads to weight gain. However, fats do have important functions. Many vitamins are fat soluble, and fats serve as a long-term storage form of fatty acids: a source of energy. They also provide insulation for the body.

Major types include fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fats are a stored form of energy and are also known as triacylglycerols or triglycerides. Fats are made up of fatty acids and either glycerol or sphingosine. Fatty acids may be unsaturated or saturated, depending on the presence or absence of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. If only single bonds are present, they are known as saturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids may have one or more double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. Phospholipids make up the matrix of membranes. They have a glycerol or sphingosine backbone to which two fatty acid chains and a phosphate-containing group are attached. Steroids are another class of lipids. Their basic structure has four fused carbon rings. Cholesterol is a type of steroid and is an important constituent of the plasma membrane, where it helps to maintain the fluid nature of the membrane. It is also the precursor of steroid hormones such as testosterone.</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

People who wish to lose weight are often told that carbohydrates are bad for them and should be avoided. Some diets completely forbid carbohydrate consumption, claiming that a low-carbohydrate diet helps people to lose weight faster. However, carbohydrates have been an important part of the human diet for thousands of years; artifacts from ancient civilizations show the presence of wheat, rice, and corn in our ancestors’ storage areas.</p> <p>Carbohydrates should be supplemented with proteins, vitamins, and fats to be parts of a well-balanced diet. Calorie-wise, a gram of carbohydrate provides 4.3 Kcal. For comparison, fats provide 9 Kcal/g, a less desirable ratio. Carbohydrates contain soluble and insoluble elements; the insoluble part is known as fiber, which is mostly cellulose. Fiber has many uses; it promotes regular bowel movement by adding bulk, and it regulates the rate of consumption of blood glucose. Fiber also helps to remove excess cholesterol from the body. In addition, a meal containing whole grains and vegetables gives a feeling of fullness. As an immediate source of energy, glucose is broken down during the process of cellular respiration, which produces ATP, the energy currency of the cell. Without the consumption of carbohydrates, the availability of “instant energy” would be reduced.</p> <p>Eliminating carbohydrates from the diet is not the best way to lose weight. A low-calorie diet that is rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean meat, together with plenty of exercise and plenty of water, is the more sensible way to lose weight.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>Learning Objectives</h3> <ul><li>Distinguish between monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides</li> <li>Identify several major functions of carbohydrates</li> </ul> </div> <p>Most people are familiar with carbohydrates, one type of macromolecule, especially when it comes to what we eat. To lose weight, some individuals adhere to “low-carb” diets. Athletes, in contrast, often “carb-load” before important competitions to ensure that they have enough energy to compete at a high level. Carbohydrates are, in fact, an essential part of our diet; grains, fruits, and vegetables are all natural sources of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates provide energy to the body, particularly through glucose, a simple sugar that is a component of starch and an ingredient in many staple foods. Carbohydrates also have other important functions in humans, animals, and plants.</p> <h2>Molecular Structures</h2> <p><strong>Carbohydrates</strong> can be represented by the stoichiometric formula (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<em>n</em>, where n is the number of carbons in the molecule. In other words, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules. This formula also explains the origin of the term “carbohydrate”: the components are carbon (“carbo”) and the components of water (hence, “hydrate”). Carbohydrates are classified into three subtypes: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.</p> <h3>Monosaccharides</h3> <p><strong>Monosaccharides</strong> (<em>mono</em>– = “one”; <em>sacchar</em>– = “sweet”) are simple sugars, the most common of which is glucose. In monosaccharides, the number of carbons usually ranges from three to seven. Most monosaccharide names end with the suffix –<em>ose</em>. If the sugar has an aldehyde group (the functional group with the structure R-CHO), it is known as an aldose, and if it has a ketone group (the functional group with the structure RC(=O)R′), it is known as a ketose. Depending on the number of carbons in the sugar, they also may be known as trioses (three carbons), pentoses (five carbons), and or hexoses (six carbons). See Figure&nbsp;1 for an illustration of the monosaccharides.</p> <div id="attachment_1589" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1589" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02224533/Figure_03_02_01.jpg" alt="The molecular structures of glyceraldehyde, an aldose, and dihydroxyacetone, a ketose, are shown.

A covalent bond formed between a carbohydrate molecule and another molecule (in this case, between two monosaccharides) is known as a <strong>glycosidic bond</strong> (Figure&nbsp;4). Glycosidic bonds (also called glycosidic linkages) can be of the alpha or the beta type.</p> <div id="attachment_1592" style="width: 585px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1592" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02224844/Figure_03_02_04.jpg" alt="The formation of sucrose from glucose and fructose is shown.

The chain may be branched or unbranched, and it may contain different types of monosaccharides. The molecular weight may be 100,000 daltons or more depending on the number of monomers joined. Starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin are primary examples of polysaccharides.</p> <p>Starch is the stored form of sugars in plants and is made up of a mixture of amylose and amylopectin (both polymers of glucose). Plants are able to synthesize glucose, and the excess glucose, beyond the plant’s immediate energy needs, is stored as starch in different plant parts, including roots and seeds. The starch in the seeds provides food for the embryo as it germinates and can also act as a source of food for humans and animals. The starch that is consumed by humans is broken down by enzymes, such as salivary amylases, into smaller molecules, such as maltose and glucose. The cells can then absorb the glucose.</p> <p>Starch is made up of glucose monomers that are joined by&nbsp;<em>α</em> 1-4 or <em>α</em> 1-6 glycosidic bonds. The numbers 1-4 and 1-6 refer to the carbon number of the two residues that have joined to form the bond.

In these animals, certain species of bacteria and protists reside in the rumen (part of the digestive system of herbivores) and secrete the enzyme cellulase. The appendix of grazing animals also contains bacteria that digest cellulose, giving it an important role in the digestive systems of ruminants. Cellulases can break down cellulose into glucose monomers that can be used as an energy source by the animal.

Insects have a hard outer exoskeleton made of chitin, a type of polysaccharide.</p> </div> <p>Carbohydrates serve various functions in different animals. Arthropods (insects, crustaceans, and others) have an outer skeleton, called the exoskeleton, which protects their internal body parts (as seen in the bee in&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;8).</p> <p>This exoskeleton is made of the biological macromolecule chitin, which is a polysaccharide-containing nitrogen.

Carbohydrates are classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides depending on the number of monomers in the molecule. Monosaccharides are linked by glycosidic bonds that are formed as a result of dehydration reactions, forming disaccharides and polysaccharides with the elimination of a water molecule for each bond formed. Glucose, galactose, and fructose are common monosaccharides, whereas common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose. Starch and glycogen, examples of polysaccharides, are the storage forms of glucose in plants and animals, respectively. The long polysaccharide chains may be branched or unbranched. Cellulose is an example of an unbranched polysaccharide, whereas amylopectin, a constituent of starch, is a highly branched molecule. Storage of glucose, in the form of polymers like starch of glycogen, makes it slightly less accessible for metabolism; however, this prevents it from leaking out of the cell or creating a high osmotic pressure that could cause excessive water uptake by the cell.</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

They carry the genetic blueprint of a cell and carry instructions for the functioning of the cell.</p> <p>The two main types of nucleic acids are&nbsp;<strong>deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</strong> and <strong>ribonucleic acid (RNA)</strong>. DNA is the genetic material found in all living organisms, ranging from single-celled bacteria to multicellular mammals. It is found in the nucleus of eukaryotes and in the organelles, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. In prokaryotes, the DNA is not enclosed in a membranous envelope.</p> <p>The entire genetic content of a cell is known as its genome, and the study of genomes is genomics. In eukaryotic cells but not in prokaryotes, DNA forms a complex with histone proteins to form chromatin, the substance of eukaryotic chromosomes. A chromosome may contain tens of thousands of genes. Many genes contain the information to make protein products; other genes code for RNA products. DNA controls all of the cellular activities by turning the genes “on” or “off.”</p> <p>The other type of nucleic acid, RNA, is mostly involved in protein synthesis. The DNA molecules never leave the nucleus but instead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell. This intermediary is the&nbsp;<strong>messenger RNA (mRNA)</strong>. Other types of RNA—like rRNA, tRNA, and microRNA—are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation.</p> <p>DNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as nucleotides. The nucleotides combine with each other to form a polynucleotide, DNA or RNA. Each nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose (five-carbon) sugar, and a phosphate group (Figure 1). Each nitrogenous base in a nucleotide is attached to a sugar molecule, which is attached to one or more phosphate groups.</p> <div id="attachment_3978" style="width: 778px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-3978" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/22210745/Figure_03_05_01-768x760.jpg" alt="The molecular structure of a nucleotide is shown.

A nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and one or more phosphate groups. Carbon residues in the pentose are numbered 1′ through 5′ (the prime distinguishes these residues from those in the base, which are numbered without using a prime notation). The base is attached to the 1′ position of the ribose, and the phosphate is attached to the 5′ position. When a polynucleotide is formed, the 5′ phosphate of the incoming nucleotide attaches to the 3′ hydroxyl group at the end of the growing chain. Two types of pentose are found in nucleotides, deoxyribose (found in DNA) and ribose (found in RNA). Deoxyribose is similar in structure to ribose, but it has an H instead of an OH at the 2′ position. Bases can be divided into two categories: purines and pyrimidines. Purines have a double ring structure, and pyrimidines have a single ring.</p> </div> <p>The nitrogenous bases, important components of nucleotides, are organic molecules and are so named because they contain carbon and nitrogen. They are bases because they contain an amino group that has the potential of binding an extra hydrogen, and thus, decreases the hydrogen ion concentration in its environment, making it more basic. Each nucleotide in DNA contains one of four possible nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G) cytosine (C), and thymine (T).&nbsp;RNA nucleotides also contain one of four possible bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil (U) rather than thymine.</p> <p>Adenine and guanine are classified as&nbsp;<strong>purines</strong>. The primary structure of a purine is two carbon-nitrogen rings. Cytosine, thymine, and uracil are classified as <strong>pyrimidines</strong> which have a single carbon-nitrogen ring as their primary structure (Figure 1). Each of these basic carbon-nitrogen rings has different functional groups attached to it. In molecular biology shorthand, the nitrogenous bases are simply known by their symbols A, T, G, C, and U. DNA contains A, T, G, and C whereas RNA contains A, U, G, and C.</p> <p>The pentose sugar in DNA is deoxyribose, and in RNA, the sugar is ribose (Figure 1). The difference between the sugars is the presence of the hydroxyl group on the second carbon of the ribose and hydrogen on the second carbon of the deoxyribose. The carbon atoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as 1′, 2′, 3′, 4′, and 5′ (1′ is read as “one prime”). The phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5′ carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the 3′ carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, which forms a 5′–3′&nbsp;<strong>phosphodiester</strong> linkage. The phosphodiester linkage is not formed by simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in macromolecules: its formation involves the removal of two phosphate groups.

The nitrogenous bases are stacked in the interior, like the steps of a staircase, in pairs; the pairs are bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Every base pair in the double helix is separated from the next base pair by 0.34 nm.</p> <p>The two strands of the helix run in opposite directions, meaning that the 5′ carbon end of one strand will face the 3′ carbon end of its matching strand.

For example, a certain purine can only pair with a certain pyrimidine. This means A can pair with T, and G can pair with C, as shown in Figure 3. This is known as the base complementary rule. In other words, the DNA strands are complementary to each other. If the sequence of one strand is AATTGGCC, the complementary strand would have the sequence TTAACCGG. During DNA replication, each strand is copied, resulting in a daughter DNA double helix containing one parental DNA strand and a newly synthesized strand.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <div id="attachment_1559" style="width: 479px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1559" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02212445/Figure_03_05_03.png" alt="Hydrogen bonding between thymine and adenine and between guanine and cytosine is shown.

RNA is usually single-stranded and is made of ribonucleotides that are linked by phosphodiester bonds. A ribonucleotide in the RNA chain contains ribose (the pentose sugar), one of the four nitrogenous bases (A, U, G, and C), and the phosphate group.</p> <p>There are four major types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and microRNA (miRNA). The first, mRNA, carries the message from DNA, which controls all of the cellular activities in a cell. If a cell requires a certain protein to be synthesized, the gene for this product is turned “on” and the messenger RNA is synthesized in the nucleus. The RNA base sequence is complementary to the coding sequence of the DNA from which it has been copied. However, in RNA, the base T is absent and U is present instead. If the DNA strand has a sequence AATTGCGC, the sequence of the complementary RNA is UUAACGCG. In the cytoplasm, the mRNA interacts with ribosomes and other cellular machinery (Figure 4).</p> <div id="attachment_1560" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1560" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02212646/Figure_03_05_04.jpg" alt="An illustration of a ribosome is shown. mRNA sits between the large and small subunits. tRNA molecules bind the ribosome and add amino acids to the growing peptide chain." width="500" height="239" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02212646/Figure_03_05_04.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02212646/Figure_03_05_04-300x143.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02212646/Figure_03_05_04-65x31.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02212646/Figure_03_05_04-225x108.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02212646/Figure_03_05_04-350x167.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4. A ribosome has two parts: a large subunit and a small subunit. The mRNA sits in between the two subunits. A tRNA molecule recognizes a codon on the mRNA, binds to it by complementary base pairing, and adds the correct amino acid to the growing peptide chain.</p> </div> <p>The mRNA is read in sets of three bases known as codons. Each codon codes for a single amino acid. In this way, the mRNA is read and the protein product is made. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a major constituent of ribosomes on which the mRNA binds. The rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes; the rRNA of the ribosome also has an enzymatic activity (peptidyl transferase) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids. Transfer RNA (tRNA) is one of the smallest of the four types of RNA, usually 70–90 nucleotides long. It carries the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis. It is the base pairing between the tRNA and mRNA that allows for the correct amino acid to be inserted in the polypeptide chain. microRNAs are the smallest RNA molecules and their role involves the regulation of gene expression by interfering with the expression of certain mRNA messages.</p> <h2>DNA versus&nbsp;RNA</h2> <p>While DNA and RNA are similar, they have very distinct differences. Table 1 summarizes features of DNA and RNA.</p> <table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Table 1. Features of DNA and RNA</th> </tr> <tr><th style="width: 20%;"></th> <th style="width: 40%;">DNA</th> <th style="width: 40%;">RNA</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr><td>Function</td> <td>Carries genetic information</td> <td>Involved in protein synthesis</td> </tr> <tr><td>Location</td> <td>Remains in the nucleus</td> <td>Leaves the nucleus</td> </tr> <tr><td>Structure</td> <td>DNA is double-stranded “ladder”: sugar-phosphate backbone, with base rungs.</td> <td>Usually single-stranded</td> </tr> <tr><td>Sugar</td> <td>Deoxyribose</td> <td>Ribose</td> </tr> <tr><td>Pyrimidines</td> <td>Cytosine, thymine</td> <td>Cytosine, uracil</td> </tr> <tr><td>Purines</td> <td>Adenine, guanine</td> <td>Adenine, guanine</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>One other difference bears mention. There is only one type of DNA.&nbsp;DNA is the heritable information that is passed along to each generation of cells; its strands can be “unzipped” with small amount of energy when DNA needs to replicate, and&nbsp;DNA is transcribed into RNA. There are mutliple types of RNA:&nbsp;Messenger RNA is a temporary molecule that transports the information necessary to make a protein from the nucleus (where the DNA remains) to the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are.&nbsp;Other kinds of RNA include ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and microRNA.</p> <p>Even though the RNA is single stranded, most RNA types show extensive intramolecular base pairing between complementary sequences, creating a predictable three-dimensional structure essential for their function.</p> <p>As you have learned, information flow in an organism takes place from DNA to RNA to protein. DNA dictates the structure of mRNA in a process known as transcription, and RNA dictates the structure of protein in a process known as translation. This is known as the Central Dogma of Life, which holds true for all organisms; however, exceptions to the rule occur in connection with viral infections.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>In Summary: Nucleic Acids</h3> <p>Nucleic acids are molecules made up of nucleotides that direct cellular activities such as cell division and protein synthesis. Each nucleotide is made up of a pentose sugar, a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. There are two types of nucleic acids: DNA and RNA. DNA carries the genetic blueprint of the cell and is passed on from parents to offspring (in the form of chromosomes). It has a double-helical structure with the two strands running in opposite directions, connected by hydrogen bonds, and complementary to each other. RNA is single-stranded and is made of a pentose sugar (ribose), a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. RNA is involved in protein synthesis and its regulation. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is copied from the DNA, is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and contains information for the construction of proteins. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a part of the ribosmes at the site of protein synthesis, whereas transfer RNA (tRNA) carries the amino acid to the site of protein synthesis. microRNA regulates the use of mRNA for protein synthesis.</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

For example, in our bodies, food is hydrolyzed, or broken down, into smaller molecules by catalytic enzymes in the digestive system. This allows for easy absorption of nutrients by cells in the intestine. Each macromolecule is broken down by a specific enzyme. For instance, carbohydrates are broken down by amylase, sucrase, lactase, or maltase. Proteins are broken down by the enzymes pepsin and peptidase, and by hydrochloric acid. Lipids are broken down by lipases. Breakdown of these macromolecules provides energy for cellular activities.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><a href="http://resource.rockyview.ab.ca/t4t/bio20/mm/m7/hydrolysis/Bio20_Hydrolysis_Final.swf" target="_blank">Visit&nbsp;this site to see visual representations of dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis.</a></div> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>In Summary: Comparing Biological Macromolecules</h3> <p>Proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and lipids are the four major classes of biological macromolecules—large molecules necessary for life that are built from smaller organic molecules. Macromolecules are made up of single units known as monomers that are joined by covalent bonds to form larger polymers. The polymer is more than the sum of its parts: it acquires new characteristics, and leads to an osmotic pressure that is much lower than that formed by its ingredients; this is an important advantage in the maintenance of cellular osmotic conditions. A monomer joins with another monomer with the release of a water molecule, leading to the formation of a covalent bond. These types of reactions are known as dehydration or condensation reactions. When polymers are broken down into smaller units (monomers), a molecule of water is used for each bond broken by these reactions; such reactions are known as hydrolysis reactions. Dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are similar for all macromolecules, but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific to its class. Dehydration reactions typically require an investment of energy for new bond formation, while hydrolysis reactions typically release energy by breaking bonds.</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-microscopy"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">34</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Microscopy</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <h2>Understand why and how the light microscope and electron microscope are used in biology</h2> <p>A cell is the smallest unit of a living thing. A living thing, whether made of one cell (like bacteria) or many cells (like a human), is called an organism. Thus, cells are the basic building blocks of all organisms.</p> <p>Several cells of one kind that interconnect with each other and perform a shared function form tissues, several tissues combine to form an organ (your stomach, heart, or brain), and several organs make up an organ system (such as the digestive system, circulatory system, or nervous system). Several systems that function together form an organism (like a human being). Here, we will examine the structure and function of cells.</p> <p>There are many types of cells, all grouped into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. For example, both animal and plant cells are classified as eukaryotic cells, whereas bacterial cells are classified as prokaryotic. Regardless of the type of cell, be it a component in a multicelled eukaryotic animal’s nervous system or a single-celled prokaryotic lifeform, biologists will use microscopes to study them.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>Learning Objectives</h3> <ul><li>Identify the general applications of light microscopes in biology</li> <li>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of electron microscopes for biological studies</li> </ul> </div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Cells vary in size. With few exceptions, individual cells cannot be seen with the naked eye, so scientists use microscopes (<em>micro</em> = “small”; <em>scope</em> = “to look at”) to study them. A <strong>microscope</strong> is an instrument that magnifies an object. Most photographs of cells are taken with a microscope, and these images can also be called micrographs.</p> <p>The optics of a microscope’s lenses change the orientation of the image that the user sees. A specimen that is right-side up and facing right on the microscope slide will appear upside-down and facing left when viewed through a microscope, and vice versa. Similarly, if the slide is moved left while looking through the microscope, it will appear to move right, and if moved down, it will seem to move up. This occurs because microscopes use two sets of lenses to magnify the image. Because of the manner by which light travels through the lenses, this system of two lenses produces an inverted image (binocular, or dissecting microscopes, work in a similar manner, but include an additional magnification system that makes the final image appear to be upright).</p> <h2>Light Microscopes</h2> <p>To give you a sense of cell size, a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a meter or eight micrometers (abbreviated as eight μm) in diameter; the head of a pin of is about two thousandths of a meter (two mm) in diameter. That means about 250 red blood cells could fit on the head of a pin.</p> <p>Most student microscopes are classified as&nbsp;<strong>light microscopes</strong> (Figure 1a). Visible light passes and is bent through the lens system to enable the user to see the specimen. Light microscopes are advantageous for viewing living organisms, but since individual cells are generally transparent, their components are not distinguishable unless they are colored with special stains. Staining, however, usually kills the cells.</p> <p>Light microscopes commonly used in the undergraduate college laboratory magnify up to approximately 400 times. Two parameters that are important in microscopy are magnification and resolving power. Magnification is the process of enlarging an object in appearance. Resolving power is the ability of a microscope to distinguish two adjacent structures as separate: the higher the resolution, the better the clarity and detail of the image. When oil immersion lenses are used for the study of small objects, magnification is usually increased to 1,000 times. In order to gain a better understanding of cellular structure and function, scientists typically use electron microscopes.</p> <div id="attachment_1600" style="width: 677px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1600" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02230424/Figure_04_01_01ab_new.jpg" alt="Part a: This light microscope has binocular lenses and four objective lenses.

(credit a: modification of work by “GcG”/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: modification of work by Evan Bench)</p> </div> <h2>Electron Microscopes</h2> <p>In contrast to light microscopes,&nbsp;<strong>electron microscopes&nbsp;</strong>(EM) (Figure 1b) use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light. Not only does this allow for higher magnification (up to 5 million times with some specialized EMs) and, thus, more detail (Figure 2), it also provides higher resolving power. The method used to prepare the specimen for viewing with an electron microscope kills the specimen. Electrons have short wavelengths (shorter than photons) that move best in a vacuum, so living cells cannot be viewed with most electron microscopes.</p> <p>In a scanning electron microscope, a beam of electrons moves back and forth across a cell’s surface, creating details of cell surface characteristics. In a transmission electron microscope, the electron beam penetrates the cell and provides details of a cell’s internal structures. As you might imagine, electron microscopes are significantly more bulky and expensive than light microscopes.</p> <div id="attachment_720" style="width: 887px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-oneonta-biology1/wp-content/uploads/sites/3650/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-06-at-9.33.39-AM.png"><img class="wp-image-720 size-full" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images-archive-read-only/wp-content/uploads/sites/414/2015/05/21035010/Screen-Shot-2015-05-06-at-9.33.39-AM.png" alt="Part a: Salmonella through a light microscope appear as tiny purple dots.

Despite the limitations of his now-ancient lenses, van Leeuwenhoek observed the movements of protista (a type of single-celled organism) and sperm, which he collectively termed “animalcules.”</p> <p>In a 1665 publication called&nbsp;<em>Micrographia</em>, experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term “cell” for the box-like structures he observed when viewing cork tissue through a lens. In the 1670s, van Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and protozoa. Later advances in lenses, microscope construction, and staining techniques enabled other scientists to see some components inside cells.</p> <p>By the late 1830s, botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and proposed the&nbsp;<strong>unified cell theory</strong>, which states that all living things are composed of one or more cells, the cell is the basic unit of life, and new cells arise from existing cells. Rudolf Virchow later made important contributions to this theory.</p> <div class="key-takeaways textbox"><h3>Cytotechnologist</h3> <div id="attachment_1601" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1601" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02230628/Figure_04_01_03.jpg" alt="Both normal cells and cells infected with HPV have an irregular, round shape and a well-defined nucleus.

In this test, a doctor takes a small sample of cells from the uterine cervix of a patient and sends it to a medical lab where a cytotechnologist stains the cells and examines them for any changes that could indicate cervical cancer or a microbial infection.</p> <p>Cytotechnologists (<em>cyto</em> = “cell”) are professionals who study cells via microscopic examinations and other laboratory tests. They are trained to determine which cellular changes are within normal limits and which are abnormal. Their focus is not limited to cervical cells; they study cellular specimens that come from all organs. When they notice abnormalities, they consult a pathologist, who is a medical doctor who can make a clinical diagnosis.</p> <p>Cytotechnologists play a vital role in saving people’s lives. When abnormalities are discovered early, a patient’s treatment can begin sooner, which usually increases the chances of a successful outcome.</p> </div> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>In Summary: Microscopy</h3> <p>A cell is the smallest unit of life.

In architecture, this means that buildings should be constructed to support the activities that will be carried out inside them. For example, a skyscraper should be built with several elevator banks; a hospital should be built so that its emergency room is easily accessible.</p> <p>Our natural world originated&nbsp;the principle of form following function, especially in cell biology, and this will become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells. Unlike prokaryotic cells,&nbsp;<strong>eukaryotic cells</strong> have: (1) a membrane-bound nucleus; (2) numerous membrane-bound <strong>organelles</strong>—such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, chloroplasts, mitochondria, and others; and (3) several, rod-shaped chromosomes. Because a eukaryotic cell’s nucleus is surrounded by a membrane, it is often said to have a “true nucleus.” The word “organelle” means “little organ,” and, as already mentioned, organelles have specialized cellular functions, just as the organs of your body have specialized functions.</p> <div id="attachment_1657" style="width: 1178px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1657" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02234646/Untitled-1.png" alt="Part a: This illustration shows a typical eukaryotic animal cell, which is egg shaped. The fluid inside the cell is called the cytoplasm, and the cell is surrounded by a cell membrane. The nucleus takes up about one-half the width of the cell. Inside the nucleus is the chromatin, which is composed of DNA and associated proteins. A region of the chromatin is condensed into the nucleolus, a structure where ribosomes are synthesized. The nucleus is encased in a nuclear envelope, which is perforated by protein-lined pores that allow entry of material into the nucleus. The nucleus is surrounded by the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, or ER. The smooth ER is the site of lipid synthesis. The rough ER has embedded ribosomes that give it a bumpy appearance. It synthesizes membrane and secretory proteins. In addition to the ER, many other organelles float inside the cytoplasm. These include the Golgi apparatus, which modifies proteins and lipids synthesized in the ER. The Golgi apparatus is made of layers of flat membranes. Mitochondria, which produce food for the cell, have an outer membrane and a highly folded inner membrane. Other, smaller organelles include peroxisomes that metabolize waste, lysosomes that digest food, and vacuoles. Ribosomes, responsible for protein synthesis, also float freely in the cytoplasm and are depicted as small dots. The last cellular component shown is the cytoskeleton, which has four different types of components: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, microtubules, and centrosomes. Microfilaments are fibrous proteins that line the cell membrane and make up the cellular cortex. Intermediate filaments are fibrous proteins that hold organelles in place. Microtubules form the mitotic spindle and maintain cell shape. Centrosomes are made of two tubular structures at right angles to one another. They form the microtubule-organizing center. Part b: This illustration depicts a typical eukaryotic plant cell. The nucleus of a plant cell contains chromatin and a nucleolus, the same as an animal cell. Other structures that the plant cell has in common with the animal cell include rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and ribosomes. The fluid inside the plant cell is called the cytoplasm, just as it is in an animal cell. The plant cell has three of the four cytoskeletal components found in animal cells: microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments. Plant cells do not have centrosomes. Plant cells have four structures not found in animals cells: chloroplasts, plastids, a central vacuole, and a cell wall. Chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis; they have an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and stack of membranes inside the inner membrane. The central vacuole is a very large, fluid-filled structure that maintains pressure against the cell wall. Plastids store pigments. The cell wall is outside the cell membrane." width="1168" height="734" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1.

The part of the cell referred to as cytoplasm is slightly different in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In eukaryotic cells, which have a nucleus, the cytoplasm is everything between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope. In prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus, cytoplasm simply means everything found inside the plasma membrane.</p> <p>One major component of the cytoplasm in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the gel-like <strong>cytosol</strong>, a water-based solution that contains ions, small molecules, and macromolecules. In eukaryotes, the cytoplasm also includes membrane-bound organelles, which are suspended in the cytosol. The cytoskeleton, a network of fibers that supports the cell and gives it shape, is also part of the cytoplasm and helps to organize cellular components.</p> <p>Even though the cytosol is mostly water, it has a semi-solid, Jello-like consistency because of the many proteins suspended in it. The cytosol contains a rich broth of macromolecules and smaller organic molecules, including glucose and other simple sugars, polysaccharides, amino acids, nucleic acids, and fatty acids. Ions of sodium, potassium, calcium, and other elements are also found in the cytosol. Many metabolic reactions, including protein synthesis, take place in this part of the cell.</p> <h2>Nucleus</h2> <div id="attachment_1637" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1637" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02233021/Figure_04_03_04.jpg" alt="The nucleus is bordered by the endoplasmic reticulum.

The nucleus stores chromatin (DNA plus proteins) in a gel-like substance called the nucleoplasm. The nucleolus is a condensed region of chromatin where ribosome synthesis occurs. The boundary of the nucleus is called the nuclear envelope. It consists of two phospholipid bilayers: an outer membrane and an inner membrane. The nuclear membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum. Nuclear pores allow substances to enter and exit the nucleus.</p> </div> <p>Typically, the nucleus is the most prominent organelle in a cell. The&nbsp;<strong>nucleus</strong> (plural = <em>nuclei</em>) houses the cell’s DNA and directs the synthesis of ribosomes and proteins. Let’s look at it in more detail (Figure 2).</p> <h3>The Nuclear Envelope</h3> <p>The&nbsp;<strong>nuclear envelope</strong> is a double-membrane structure that constitutes the outermost portion of the nucleus (Figure 2). Both the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are phospholipid bilayers.</p> <p>The nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions, molecules, and RNA between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. The&nbsp;<strong>nucleoplasm</strong> is the semi-solid fluid inside the nucleus, where we find the chromatin and the nucleolus.</p> <h3>Chromatin and Chromosomes</h3> <p>To understand chromatin, it is helpful to first consider chromosomes.&nbsp;<strong>Chromosomes</strong> are structures within the nucleus that are made up of DNA, the hereditary material. In prokaryotes, DNA is organized into a single circular chromosome. In eukaryotes, chromosomes are linear structures. Every eukaryotic species has a specific number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its body’s cells. For example, in humans, the chromosome number is 46, while in fruit flies, it is eight. Chromosomes are only visible and distinguishable from one another when the cell is getting ready to divide. When the cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle, proteins are attached to chromosomes, and they resemble an unwound, jumbled bunch of threads. These unwound protein-chromosome complexes are called <strong>chromatin</strong> (Figure 3); chromatin describes the material that makes up the chromosomes both when condensed and decondensed. We will focus on chromatin and chromosomes in greater detail later.</p> <div id="attachment_1661" style="width: 1178px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1661" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02235200/figure-5.png" alt="Part a: In this illustration, DNA tightly coiled into two thick cylinders is shown in the upper right.

Some chromosomes have sections of DNA that encode ribosomal RNA. A darkly staining area within the nucleus called the nucleolus (plural = nucleoli) aggregates the ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that are then transported out through the pores in the nuclear envelope to the cytoplasm.</p> <h2>Ribosomes</h2> <div id="attachment_1690" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1690" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03000535/Figure_04_03_06-300x243.jpg" alt="The ribosome consists of a small subunit and a large subunit, which is about three times as big as the small one.

Ribosomes are made up of a large subunit (top) and a small subunit (bottom). During protein synthesis, ribosomes assemble amino acids into proteins.</p> </div> <p><strong>Ribosomes</strong> are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. When viewed through an electron microscope, ribosomes appear either as clusters (polyribosomes) or single, tiny dots that float freely in the cytoplasm. They may be attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum and the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope. Electron microscopy has shown us that ribosomes, which are large complexes of protein and RNA, consist of two subunits, aptly called large and small (Figure 4). Ribosomes receive their “orders” for protein synthesis from the nucleus where the DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA travels to the ribosomes, which translate the code provided by the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into a specific order of amino acids in a protein. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.</p> <p>Because proteins synthesis is an essential function of all cells, ribosomes are found in practically every cell. Ribosomes are particularly abundant in cells that synthesize large amounts of protein. For example, the pancreas is responsible for creating several digestive enzymes and the cells that produce these enzymes contain many ribosomes. Thus, we see another example of form following function.</p> <h2>Mitochondria</h2> <p><strong>Mitochondria</strong> (singular = <em>mitochondrion</em>) are often called the “powerhouses” or “energy factories” of a cell because they are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell’s main energy-carrying molecule. ATP represents the short-term stored energy of the cell. Cellular respiration is the process of making ATP using the chemical energy found in glucose and other nutrients. In mitochondria, this process uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. In fact, the carbon dioxide that you exhale with every breath comes from the cellular reactions that produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct.</p> <p>In keeping with our theme of form following function, it is important to point out that muscle cells have a very high concentration of mitochondria that produce ATP. Your muscle cells need a lot of energy to keep your body moving. When your cells don’t get enough oxygen, they do not make a lot of ATP. Instead, the small amount of ATP they make in the absence of oxygen is accompanied by the production of lactic acid.</p> <div id="attachment_1665" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1665" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02235354/Figure_04_03_07.jpg" alt="This transmission electron micrograph of a mitochondrion shows an oval outer membrane and an inner membrane with many folds called cristae.

Each membrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. The inner layer has folds called cristae. The area surrounded by the folds is called the mitochondrial matrix. The cristae and the matrix have different roles in cellular respiration.</p> <h2>Peroxisomes</h2> <p>Peroxisomes are small, round organelles enclosed by single membranes. They carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids. They also detoxify many poisons that may enter the body. Many of these oxidation reactions release hydrogen peroxide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which would be damaging to cells; however, when these reactions are confined to peroxisomes, enzymes safely break down the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into oxygen and water. For example, alcohol is detoxified by peroxisomes in liver cells. Glyoxysomes, which are specialized peroxisomes in plants, are responsible for converting stored fats into sugars.</p> <h2>Endomembrane System</h2> <div id="attachment_1682" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1682" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03000049/Figure_04_04_01.png" alt="The left part of this figure shows the rough ER with an integral membrane protein embedded in it.

It includes the nuclear envelope, lysosomes, vesicles, and the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which we will cover shortly. Although not technically <em>within</em> the cell, the plasma membrane is included in the endomembrane system because, as you will see, it interacts with the other endomembranous organelles. The endomembrane system does not include the membranes of either mitochondria or chloroplasts.</p> <p>Figure 6&nbsp;illustrates the connections of the endomembrane system as a (green) integral membrane protein in the ER is modified by attachment of a (purple) carbohydrate. Vesicles with the integral protein bud from the ER and fuse with the <em>cis</em> face of the Golgi apparatus. As the protein passes along the Golgi’s cisternae, it is further modified by the addition of more carbohydrates. After its synthesis is complete, it exits as integral membrane protein of the vesicle that bud from the Golgi’s <em>trans</em> face and when the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane the protein becomes integral portion of that cell membrane.</p> <h3>The Endoplasmic Reticulum</h3> <p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 6) is a series of interconnected membranous sacs and tubules that collectively modifies proteins and synthesizes lipids.

Functions of the SER include synthesis of carbohydrates, lipids, and steroid hormones; detoxification of medications and poisons; and storage of calcium ions.</p> <p>In muscle cells, a specialized SER called the sarcoplasmic reticulum is responsible for storage of the calcium ions that are needed to trigger the coordinated contractions of the muscle cells.</p> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>Cardiology</h3> <p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. This is primarily due to our sedentary lifestyle and our high trans-fat diets.</p> <p>Heart failure is just one of many disabling heart conditions.

Left untreated, heart failure can lead to kidney failure and failure of other organs.</p> <p>The wall of the heart is composed of cardiac muscle tissue. Heart failure occurs when the endoplasmic reticula of cardiac muscle cells do not function properly. As a result, an insufficient number of calcium ions are available to trigger a sufficient contractile force.</p> <p>Cardiologists (<em>cardi</em> = “heart”; <em>ologist</em> = “one who studies”) are doctors who specialize in treating heart diseases, including heart failure. Cardiologists can make a diagnosis of heart failure via physical examination, results from an electrocardiogram (ECG, a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart), a chest X-ray to see whether the heart is enlarged, and other tests. If heart failure is diagnosed, the cardiologist will typically prescribe appropriate medications and recommend a reduction in table salt intake and a supervised exercise program.</p> </div> <h3>The Golgi Apparatus</h3> <div id="attachment_1686" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1686" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03000242/Figure_04_04_03.jpg" alt="In this transmission electron micrograph, the Golgi apparatus appears as a stack of membranes surrounded by unnamed organelles." width="450" height="227" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03000242/Figure_04_04_03.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03000242/Figure_04_04_03-300x152.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03000242/Figure_04_04_03-65x33.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03000242/Figure_04_04_03-225x114.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03000242/Figure_04_04_03-350x177.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 8.

(credit: modification of work by Louisa Howard)</p> </div> <p>We have already mentioned that vesicles can bud from the ER and transport their contents elsewhere, but where do the vesicles go? Before reaching their final destination, the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles still need to be sorted, packaged, and tagged so that they wind up in the right place. Sorting, tagging, packaging, and distribution of lipids and proteins takes place in the Golgi apparatus (also called the Golgi body), a series of flattened membranes (Figure 8).</p> <p>The receiving side of the Golgi apparatus is called the&nbsp;<em>cis</em> face. The opposite side is called the <em>trans</em> face. The transport vesicles that formed from the ER travel to the <em>cis</em> face, fuse with it, and empty their contents into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. As the proteins and lipids travel through the Golgi, they undergo further modifications that allow them to be sorted. The most frequent modification is the addition of short chains of sugar molecules. These newly modified proteins and lipids are then tagged with phosphate groups or other small molecules so that they can be routed to their proper destinations.</p> <p>Finally, the modified and tagged proteins are packaged into secretory vesicles that bud from the&nbsp;<em>trans</em> face of the Golgi.

One such disease is Lowe disease (also called oculocerebrorenal syndrome, because it affects the eyes, brain, and kidneys). In Lowe disease, there is a deficiency in an enzyme localized to the Golgi apparatus. Children with Lowe disease are born with cataracts, typically develop kidney disease after the first year of life, and may have impaired mental abilities.</p> <p>Lowe disease is a genetic disease caused by a mutation on the X chromosome. The X chromosome is one of the two human sex chromosome, as these chromosomes determine a person’s sex. Females possess two X chromosomes while males possess one X and one Y chromosome. In females, the genes on only one of the two X chromosomes are expressed. Therefore, females who carry the Lowe disease gene on one of their X chromosomes have a 50/50 chance of having the disease. However, males only have one X chromosome and the genes on this chromosome are always expressed. Therefore, males will always have Lowe disease if their X chromosome carries the Lowe disease gene. The location of the mutated gene, as well as the locations of many other mutations that cause genetic diseases, has now been identified. Through prenatal testing, a woman can find out if the fetus she is carrying may be afflicted with one of several genetic diseases.</p> <p>Geneticists analyze the results of prenatal genetic tests and may counsel pregnant women on available options. They may also conduct genetic research that leads to new drugs or foods, or perform DNA analyses that are used in forensic investigations.</p> </div> <h2>Vesicles</h2> <p><strong>Vesicles</strong>, like vacuoles (which we will address soon),&nbsp;are membrane-bound sacs that function in storage and transport. Other than the fact that vacuoles are somewhat larger than vesicles, there is a very subtle distinction between them: the membranes of vesicles can fuse with either the plasma membrane or other membrane systems within the cell. The membrane of a vacuole does not fuse with the membranes of other cellular components.</p> <p>A vesicle consists of fluid enclosed by a lipid bilayer. Vesicles form naturally during the processes of secretion (exocytosis), uptake (phagocytosis) and transport of materials within the cytoplasm. Alternatively, they may be prepared artificially, in which case they are called liposomes. Vesicles can fuse with the plasma membrane to release their contents outside the cell. Vesicles can also fuse with other organelles within the cell.</p> <p>Vesicles perform a variety of functions. Because they are separated from the cytosol, the inside of a vesicle can be different from the cytosolic environment. For this reason, vesicles are a basic tool used by the cell for organizing cellular substances. Vesicles are involved in metabolism, transport, buoyancy control, and enzyme storage. They can also act as chemical reaction chambers.</p> <h2>Unique Features of Animal and Plant Cells</h2> <p>At this point, you know that each eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, a nucleus, ribosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and in some, vacuoles, but there are some striking differences between animal and plant cells. While both animal and plant cells have microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), animal cells also have centrioles associated with the MTOC: a complex called the centrosome. Animal cells each have a centrosome and lysosomes, whereas plant cells do not. Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts and other specialized plastids, and a large central vacuole, whereas animal cells do not.</p> <h3>Properties of Animal Cells</h3> <div id="attachment_3566" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-3566" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/11/30193654/Figure_04_03_08.jpg" alt="Figure 1.

Nontubulin proteins (indicated by the green lines) hold the microtubule triplets together.</p> </div> <h4>The Centrosome</h4> <p>The centrosome is a microtubule-organizing center found near the nuclei of animal cells. It contains a pair of centrioles, two structures that lie perpendicular to each other (Figure 9). Each centriole is a cylinder of nine triplets of microtubules.</p> <p>The centrosome (the organelle where all microtubules originate) replicates itself before a cell divides, and the centrioles appear to have some role in pulling the duplicated chromosomes to opposite ends of the dividing cell. However, the exact function of the centrioles in cell division isn’t clear, because cells that have had the centrosome removed can still divide, and plant cells, which lack centrosomes, are capable of cell division.</p> <h4>Lysosomes</h4> <div id="attachment_4526" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-4526" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/03/23193611/Figure_04_04_04.jpg" alt="In this illustration, a eukaryotic cell is shown consuming a bacterium.

A macrophage has engulfed (phagocytized) a potentially pathogenic bacterium and then fuses with a lysosomes within the cell to destroy the pathogen. Other organelles are present in the cell but for simplicity are not shown.</p> </div> <p>In addition to their role as the digestive component and organelle-recycling facility of animal cells, lysosomes are considered to be parts of the endomembrane system.</p> <p>Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to destroy pathogens (disease-causing organisms) that might enter the cell. A good example of this occurs in a group of white blood cells called macrophages, which are part of your body’s immune system. In a process known as phagocytosis or endocytosis, a section of the plasma membrane of the macrophage invaginates (folds in) and engulfs a pathogen. The invaginated section, with the pathogen inside, then pinches itself off from the plasma membrane and becomes a vesicle. The vesicle fuses with a lysosome. The lysosome’s hydrolytic enzymes then destroy the pathogen (Figure 10).</p> <h3>Properties of Plant Cells</h3> <h4>Chloroplasts</h4> <div id="attachment_1677" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1677" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02235810/Figure_04_03_10.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a chloroplast, which has an outer membrane and an inner membrane.

The chloroplast has an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and membrane structures called thylakoids that are stacked into grana. The space inside the thylakoid membranes is called the thylakoid space. The light harvesting reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes, and the synthesis of sugar takes place in the fluid inside the inner membrane, which is called the stroma. Chloroplasts also have their own genome, which is contained on a single circular chromosome.</p> </div> <p>Like the mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes (we’ll talk about these later!), but chloroplasts have an entirely different function. Chloroplasts are plant cell organelles that carry out photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the series of reactions that use carbon dioxide, water, and light energy to make glucose and oxygen. This is a major difference between plants and animals; plants (autotrophs) are able to make their own food, like sugars, while animals (heterotrophs) must ingest their food.</p> <p>Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have outer and inner membranes, but within the space enclosed by a chloroplast’s inner membrane is a set of interconnected and stacked fluid-filled membrane sacs called thylakoids (Figure 11). Each stack of thylakoids is called a granum (plural = grana). The fluid enclosed by the inner membrane that surrounds the grana is called the stroma.</p> <p>The chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which captures the light energy that drives the reactions of photosynthesis. Like plant cells, photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts. Some bacteria perform photosynthesis, but their chlorophyll is not relegated to an organelle.</p> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>Endosymbiosis</h3> <p>We have mentioned that both mitochondria and chloroplasts contain DNA and ribosomes. Have you wondered why? Strong evidence points to endosymbiosis as the explanation.</p> <p>Symbiosis is a relationship in which organisms from two separate species depend on each other for their survival. Endosymbiosis (<em>endo</em>– = “within”) is a mutually beneficial relationship in which one organism lives inside the other. Endosymbiotic relationships abound in nature. We have already mentioned that microbes that produce vitamin K live inside the human gut. This relationship is beneficial for us because we are unable to synthesize vitamin K. It is also beneficial for the microbes because they are protected from other organisms and from drying out, and they receive abundant food from the environment of the large intestine.</p> <p>Scientists have long noticed that bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are similar in size. We also know that bacteria have DNA and ribosomes, just as mitochondria and chloroplasts do. Scientists believe that host cells and bacteria formed an endosymbiotic relationship when the host cells ingested both aerobic and autotrophic bacteria (cyanobacteria) but did not destroy them. Through many millions of years of evolution, these ingested bacteria became more specialized in their functions, with the aerobic bacteria becoming mitochondria and the autotrophic bacteria becoming chloroplasts.</p> </div> <h4>Vacuoles</h4> <p><strong>Vacuoles</strong> are membrane-bound sacs that function in storage and transport. The membrane of a vacuole does not fuse with the membranes of other cellular components. Additionally, some agents such as enzymes within plant vacuoles break down macromolecules.</p> <h4>The Central Vacuole</h4> <p>If you look at&nbsp;Figure 1b, you will see that plant cells each have a large central vacuole that occupies most of the area of the cell. The <strong>central vacuole</strong> plays a key role in regulating the cell’s concentration of water in changing environmental conditions. Have you ever noticed that if you forget to water a plant for a few days, it wilts? That’s because as the water concentration in the soil becomes lower than the water concentration in the plant, water moves out of the central vacuoles and cytoplasm. As the central vacuole shrinks, it leaves the cell wall unsupported. This loss of support to the cell walls of plant cells results in the wilted appearance of the plant.</p> <p>The central vacuole also supports the expansion of the cell. When the central vacuole holds more water, the cell gets larger without having to invest a lot of energy in synthesizing new cytoplasm. You can rescue wilted celery in your refrigerator using this process. Simply cut the end off the stalks and place them in a cup of water. Soon the celery will be stiff and crunchy again.</p> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

Microfilaments are made of two intertwined strands of actin.</p> </div> <p>Of the three types of protein fibers in the cytoskeleton, <strong>microfilaments</strong> are the narrowest. They function in cellular movement, have a diameter of about 7 nm, and are made of two intertwined strands of a globular protein called actin (Figure 2). For this reason, microfilaments are also known as actin filaments.</p> <p>Actin is powered by ATP to assemble its filamentous form, which serves as a track for the movement of a motor protein called myosin. This enables actin to engage in cellular events requiring motion, such as cell division in animal cells and cytoplasmic streaming, which is the circular movement of the cell cytoplasm in plant cells. Actin and myosin are plentiful in muscle cells. When your actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, your muscles contract.</p> <p>Microfilaments also provide some rigidity and shape to the cell. They can depolymerize (disassemble) and reform quickly, thus enabling a cell to change its shape and move. White blood cells (your body’s infection-fighting cells) make good use of this ability.

The primary components of these materials are proteins, and the most abundant protein is collagen. Collagen fibers are interwoven with carbohydrate-containing protein molecules called proteoglycans. Collectively, these materials are called the&nbsp;<strong>extracellular matrix</strong> (Figure 1). Not only does the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue, but it also allows the cells within the tissue to communicate with each other. How can this happen?</p> <div id="attachment_1712" style="width: 485px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1712" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03185441/Figure_04_06_01.jpg" alt="This illustration shows the plasma membrane.

The extracellular matrix consists of a network of proteins and carbohydrates.</p> </div> <p>Cells have protein receptors on the extracellular surfaces of their plasma membranes. When a molecule within the matrix binds to the receptor, it changes the molecular structure of the receptor. The receptor, in turn, changes the conformation of the microfilaments positioned just inside the plasma membrane. These conformational changes induce chemical signals inside the cell that reach the nucleus and turn “on” or “off” the transcription of specific sections of DNA, which affects the production of associated proteins, thus changing the activities within the cell.</p> <p>Blood clotting provides an example of the role of the extracellular matrix in cell communication. When the cells lining a blood vessel are damaged, they display a protein receptor called tissue factor. When tissue factor binds with another factor in the extracellular matrix, it causes platelets to adhere to the wall of the damaged blood vessel, stimulates the adjacent smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel to contract (thus constricting the blood vessel), and initiates a series of steps that stimulate the platelets to produce clotting factors.</p> <h2>Intercellular Junctions</h2> <p>Cells can also communicate with each other via direct contact, referred to as intercellular junctions. There are some differences in the ways that plant and animal cells do this. Plasmodesmata are junctions between plant cells, whereas animal cell contacts include tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.</p> <h3>Plasmodesmata</h3> <p>In general, long stretches of the plasma membranes of neighboring plant cells cannot touch one another because they are separated by the cell wall that surrounds each cell. How then, can a plant transfer water and other soil nutrients from its roots, through its stems, and to its leaves? Such transport uses the vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) primarily. There also exist structural modifications called plasmodesmata (singular = plasmodesma), numerous channels that pass between cell walls of adjacent plant cells, connect their cytoplasm, and enable materials to be transported from cell to cell, and thus throughout the plant (Figure 2).</p> <div id="attachment_1714" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1714" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03185551/Figure_04_06_02.jpg" alt="This illustration shows two plant cells side-by-side.

The plasma membrane controls the passage of organic molecules, ions, water, and oxygen into and out of the cell.

Such cells are typically found lining the small intestine, the organ that absorbs nutrients from digested food. This is an excellent example of form following function. People with celiac disease have an immune response to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The immune response damages microvilli, and thus, afflicted individuals cannot absorb nutrients. This leads to malnutrition, cramping, and diarrhea. Patients suffering from celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet.</p> <div id="attachment_1623" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1623" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02232314/Figure_04_03_03a.jpg" alt="The left part of this figure is a transmission electron micrograph of microvilli, which appear as long, slender stalks extending from the plasma membrane.

The fluid inside the cell is called the cytoplasm, and the cell is surrounded by a cell membrane. The nucleus takes up about one-half the width of the cell. Inside the nucleus is the chromatin, which is composed of DNA and associated proteins. A region of the chromatin is condensed into the nucleolus, a structure where ribosomes are synthesized. The nucleus is encased in a nuclear envelope, which is perforated by protein-lined pores that allow entry of material into the nucleus. The nucleus is surrounded by the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, or ER. The smooth ER is the site of lipid synthesis. The rough ER has embedded ribosomes that give it a bumpy appearance. It synthesizes membrane and secretory proteins. In addition to the ER, many other organelles float inside the cytoplasm. These include the Golgi apparatus, which modifies proteins and lipids synthesized in the ER. The Golgi apparatus is made of layers of flat membranes. Mitochondria, which produce food for the cell, have an outer membrane and a highly folded inner membrane. Other, smaller organelles include peroxisomes that metabolize waste, lysosomes that digest food, and vacuoles. Ribosomes, responsible for protein synthesis, also float freely in the cytoplasm and are depicted as small dots. The last cellular component shown is the cytoskeleton, which has four different types of components: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, microtubules, and centrosomes. Microfilaments are fibrous proteins that line the cell membrane and make up the cellular cortex. Intermediate filaments are fibrous proteins that hold organelles in place. Microtubules form the mitotic spindle and maintain cell shape. Centrosomes are made of two tubular structures at right angles to one another. They form the microtubule-organizing center. Part b: This illustration depicts a typical eukaryotic plant cell. The nucleus of a plant cell contains chromatin and a nucleolus, the same as an animal cell. Other structures that the plant cell has in common with the animal cell include rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and ribosomes. The fluid inside the plant cell is called the cytoplasm, just as it is in an animal cell. The plant cell has three of the four cytoskeletal components found in animal cells: microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments. Plant cells do not have centrosomes. Plant cells have four structures not found in animals cells: chloroplasts, plastids, a central vacuole, and a cell wall. Chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis; they have an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and stack of membranes inside the inner membrane. The central vacuole is a very large, fluid-filled structure that maintains pressure against the cell wall. Plastids store pigments. The cell wall is outside the cell membrane." width="1121" height="648" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02234646/Untitled-1-e1462912482725.png 1121w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02234646/Untitled-1-e1462912482725-300x173.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02234646/Untitled-1-e1462912482725-768x444.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02234646/Untitled-1-e1462912482725-1024x592.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02234646/Untitled-1-e1462912482725-65x38.png 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02234646/Untitled-1-e1462912482725-225x130.png 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02234646/Untitled-1-e1462912482725-350x202.png 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 8.

Fungal and protistan cells also have cell walls, as do some prokaryotic cells. While the chief component of prokaryotic cell walls is peptidoglycan, the major organic molecule in the plant cell wall is cellulose (Figure 9), a polysaccharide made up of glucose units.

Plasma membranes enclose the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly in flux. The plasma membrane must be sufficiently flexible to allow certain cells, such as red blood cells and white blood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These are the more obvious functions of a plasma membrane. In addition, the surface of the plasma membrane carries markers that allow cells to recognize one another, which is vital as tissues and organs form during early development, and which later plays a role in the “self” versus “non-self” distinction of the immune response.</p> <p>The plasma membrane also carries receptors, which are attachment sites for specific substances that interact with the cell. Each receptor is structured to bind with a specific substance. For example, surface receptors of the membrane create changes in the interior, such as changes in enzymes of metabolic pathways. These metabolic pathways might be vital for providing the cell with energy, making specific substances for the cell, or breaking down cellular waste or toxins for disposal. Receptors on the plasma membrane’s exterior surface interact with hormones or neurotransmitters, and allow their messages to be transmitted into the cell. Some recognition sites are used by viruses as attachment points. Although they are highly specific, pathogens like viruses may evolve to exploit receptors to gain entry to a cell by mimicking the specific substance that the receptor is meant to bind. This specificity helps to explain why human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or any of the five types of hepatitis viruses invade only specific cells.</p> <h3>Fluid Mosaic Model</h3> <p>In 1972, S. J. Singer and Garth L. Nicolson proposed a new model of the plasma membrane that, compared to earlier understanding, better explained both microscopic observations and the function of the plasma membrane. This was called the&nbsp;<strong>fluid mosaic model</strong>. The model has evolved somewhat over time, but still best accounts for the structure and functions of the plasma membrane as we now understand them. The fluid mosaic model describes the structure of the plasma membrane as a mosaic of components—including phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates—in which the components are able to flow and change position, while maintaining the basic integrity of the membrane. Both phospholipid molecules and embedded proteins are able to diffuse rapidly and laterally in the membrane (Figure 1). The fluidity of the plasma membrane is necessary for the activities of certain enzymes and transport molecules within the membrane. Plasma membranes range from 5–10 nm thick. As a comparison, human red blood cells, visible via light microscopy, are approximately 8 µm thick, or approximately 1,000 times thicker than a plasma membrane.</p> <div id="attachment_1603" style="width: 909px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1603" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02231126/Figure_05_01_01.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a phospholipid bilayer with proteins and cholesterol embedded in it.

The fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane structure describes the plasma membrane as a fluid combination of phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates.</p> </div> <p>The plasma membrane is made up primarily of a bilayer of phospholipids with embedded proteins, carbohydrates, glycolipids, and glycoproteins, and, in animal cells, cholesterol. The amount of cholesterol in animal plasma membranes regulates the fluidity of the membrane and changes based on the temperature of the cell’s environment. In other words, cholesterol acts as antifreeze in the cell membrane and is more abundant in animals that live in cold climates.</p> <p>The main fabric of the membrane is composed of two layers of phospholipid molecules, and the polar ends of these molecules (which look like a collection of balls in an artist’s rendition of the model) (Figure 1) are in contact with aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell. Thus, both surfaces of the plasma membrane are hydrophilic (“water-loving”). In contrast, the interior of the membrane, between its two surfaces, is a hydrophobic (“water-hating”) or nonpolar region because of the fatty acid tails. This region has no attraction for water or other polar molecules (we will discuss this further in the next page).</p> <p>Proteins make up the second major chemical component of plasma membranes. Integral proteins are embedded in the plasma membrane and may span all or part of the membrane. Integral proteins may serve as channels or pumps to move materials into or out of the cell. Peripheral proteins are found on the exterior or interior surfaces of membranes, attached either to integral proteins or to phospholipid molecules. Both integral and peripheral proteins may serve as enzymes, as structural attachments for the fibers of the cytoskeleton, or as part of the cell’s recognition sites.</p> <p>Carbohydrates are the third major component of plasma membranes. They are always found on the exterior surface of cells and are bound either to proteins (forming glycoproteins) or to lipids (forming glycolipids). These carbohydrate chains may consist of 2–60 monosaccharide units and may be either straight or branched. Along with peripheral proteins, carbohydrates form specialized sites on the cell surface that allow cells to recognize each other.</p> <div class="key-takeaways textbox"><h3>How Viruses Infect Specific Organs</h3> <div id="attachment_1605" style="width: 268px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1605 size-medium" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02231211/Figure_05_01_05-258x300.jpg" alt="This illustration shows the plasma membrane of a T cell.

HIV docks at and binds to the CD4 receptor, a glycoprotein on the surface of T cells, before entering, or infecting, the cell. (credit: modification of work by US National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases)</p> </div> <p>Specific glycoprotein molecules exposed on the surface of the cell membranes of host cells are exploited by many viruses to infect specific organs. For example, HIV is able to penetrate the plasma membranes of specific kinds of white blood cells called T-helper cells and monocytes, as well as some cells of the central nervous system. The hepatitis virus attacks only liver cells.</p> <p>These viruses are able to invade these cells, because the cells have binding sites on their surfaces that the viruses have exploited with equally specific glycoproteins in their coats. (Figure 2). The cell is tricked by the mimicry of the virus coat molecules, and the virus is able to enter the cell. Other recognition sites on the virus’s surface interact with the human immune system, prompting the body to produce antibodies. Antibodies are made in response to the antigens (or proteins associated with invasive pathogens). These same sites serve as places for antibodies to attach, and either destroy or inhibit the activity of the virus. Unfortunately, these sites on HIV are encoded by genes that change quickly, making the production of an effective vaccine against the virus very difficult. The virus population within an infected individual quickly evolves through mutation into different populations, or variants, distinguished by differences in these recognition sites. This rapid change of viral surface markers decreases the effectiveness of the person’s immune system in attacking the virus, because the antibodies will not recognize the new variations of the surface patterns.</p> </div> <h2>Phospholipids</h2> <p>As we just learned, the main fabric of the membrane is composed of two layers of phospholipid molecules.&nbsp;The <span data-type="term">hydrophilic</span> or “water-loving” areas of these molecules (which looks like a collection of balls in an artist’s rendition of the model) (Figure&nbsp;1) are in contact with the aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell.&nbsp;Thus, both surfaces of the plasma membrane are hydrophilic. In contrast, the interior of the membrane, between its two surfaces, is a hydrophobic or nonpolar region because of the fatty acid tails. This region has no attraction for water or other polar molecules (we will discuss this further in the next page).</p> <p><span data-type="term">Hydrophobic</span>, or water-hating molecules, tend to be non-polar. They interact with other non-polar molecules in chemical reactions, but generally do not interact with polar molecules. When placed in water, hydrophobic molecules tend to form a ball or cluster. The hydrophilic regions of the phospholipids tend to form hydrogen bonds with water and other polar molecules on both the exterior and interior of the cell. Thus, the membrane surfaces that face the interior and exterior of the cell are hydrophilic. In contrast, the interior of the cell membrane is hydrophobic and will not interact with water. Therefore, phospholipids form an excellent two-layer cell membrane that separates fluid within the cell from the fluid outside of the cell.</p> <div id="attachment_4528" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-4528" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/03/23194300/Figure_05_01_02b.jpg" alt="An illustration of a phospholipid shows a hydrophilic head group composed of phosphate connected to a three-carbon glycerol molecule, and two hydrophobic tails composed of long hydrocarbon chains." width="450" height="447" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/03/23194300/Figure_05_01_02b.jpg 615w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/03/23194300/Figure_05_01_02b-150x150.jpg 150w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/03/23194300/Figure_05_01_02b-300x298.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/03/23194300/Figure_05_01_02b-65x65.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/03/23194300/Figure_05_01_02b-225x224.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/03/23194300/Figure_05_01_02b-350x348.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3.

The plasma membrane is composed of a bilayer of phospholipids, with their hydrophobic, fatty acid tails in contact with each other. The landscape of the membrane is studded with proteins, some of which span the membrane. Some of these proteins serve to transport materials into or out of the cell. Carbohydrates are attached to some of the proteins and lipids on the outward-facing surface of the membrane. These form complexes that function to identify the cell to other cells. The fluid nature of the membrane owes itself to the configuration of the fatty acid tails, the presence of cholesterol embedded in the membrane (in animal cells), and the mosaic nature of the proteins and protein-carbohydrate complexes, which are not firmly fixed in place. Plasma membranes enclose the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly in flux.</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

In other words, plasma membranes are&nbsp;<strong>selectively permeable</strong>—they allow some substances to pass through, but not others. If they were to lose this selectivity, the cell would no longer be able to sustain itself, and it would be destroyed. Some cells require larger amounts of specific substances than do other cells; they must have a way of obtaining these materials from extracellular fluids. This may happen passively, as certain materials move back and forth, or the cell may have special mechanisms that facilitate transport. Some materials are so important to a cell that it spends some of its energy, hydrolyzing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to obtain these materials. Red blood cells use some of their energy doing just that. All cells spend the majority of their energy to maintain an imbalance of sodium and potassium ions between the interior and exterior of the cell.</p> <p>The most direct forms of membrane transport are passive.&nbsp;<strong>Passive transport</strong> is a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not require the cell to exert any of its energy to accomplish the movement. In passive transport, substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. A physical space in which there is a range of concentrations of a single substance is said to have a <strong>concentration gradient</strong>.</p> <h3>Selective Permeability</h3> <p>Plasma membranes are asymmetric: the interior of the membrane is not identical to the exterior of the membrane. In fact, there is a considerable difference between the array of phospholipids and proteins between the two leaflets that form a membrane. On the interior of the membrane, some proteins serve to anchor the membrane to fibers of the cytoskeleton. There are peripheral proteins on the exterior of the membrane that bind elements of the extracellular matrix. Carbohydrates, attached to lipids or proteins, are also found on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane. These carbohydrate complexes help the cell bind substances that the cell needs in the extracellular fluid. This adds considerably to the selective nature of plasma membranes (Figure 1).</p> <div style="width: 909px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1615" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02231732/Figure_04_03_02.jpg" alt="The plasma membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer.

The eukaryotic plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer with proteins and cholesterol embedded in it.</p> </div> <p>Recall that plasma membranes are amphiphilic: they have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. This characteristic helps the movement of some materials through the membrane and hinders the movement of others. Lipid-soluble material with a low molecular weight can easily slip through the hydrophobic lipid core of the membrane. Substances such as the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K readily pass through the plasma membranes in the digestive tract and other tissues. Fat-soluble drugs and hormones also gain easy entry into cells and are readily transported into the body’s tissues and organs. Molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide have no charge and so pass through membranes by simple diffusion.</p> <p>Polar substances present problems for the membrane. While some polar molecules connect easily with the outside of a cell, they cannot readily pass through the lipid core of the plasma membrane. Additionally, while small ions could easily slip through the spaces in the mosaic of the membrane, their charge prevents them from doing so. Ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride must have special means of penetrating plasma membranes. Simple sugars and amino acids also need help with transport across plasma membranes, achieved by various transmembrane proteins (channels).</p> <h3>Diffusion</h3> <div id="attachment_2231" style="width: 359px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-2231" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/16171609/Dispersion.gif" alt="Yellow food coloring spreading in water.

The food coloring was added to the cold water slightly before the coloring was added to the hot water, yet after a few seconds it has spread more thoroughly in the hot water. The frames are roughly 1 second apart (so the animation is roughly 2x real-time). The dispersion is caused by convective mass flow due to concentration gradients, temperature gradients, bulk convective flow from localized density gradients. Currents and eddies are clearly visible. If the food coloring was to move throughout the container purely by diffussion, assuming a diffusion coeficient of 10^-12 m^2/s, it would take approximately 10^10 seconds for the dye to reach a 90% equilibrium." width="349" height="265" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2. Dispersion</p> </div> <p><strong>Diffusion</strong> is a passive process of transport (see Figure 2).

The ammonia gas is at its highest concentration in the bottle; its lowest concentration is at the edges of the room. The ammonia vapor will diffuse, or spread away, from the bottle, and gradually, more and more people will smell the ammonia as it spreads. Materials move within the cell’s cytosol by diffusion, and certain materials move through the plasma membrane by diffusion (Figure 3). Diffusion expends no energy. On the contrary, concentration gradients are a form of potential energy, dissipated as the gradient is eliminated.</p> <div id="attachment_1724" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1724" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03190518/Figure_03_05_011.jpg" alt="The left part of this illustration shows a substance on one side of a membrane only.

Diffusion through a permeable membrane moves a substance from an area of high concentration (extracellular fluid, in this case) down its concentration gradient (into the cytoplasm). (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)</p> </div> <p>Each separate substance in a medium, such as the extracellular fluid, has its own concentration gradient, independent of the concentration gradients of other materials. In addition, each substance will diffuse according to that gradient. Within a system, there will be different rates of diffusion of the different substances in the medium.</p> <h3>Factors That Affect Diffusion</h3> <p>Molecules move constantly in a random manner, at a rate that depends on their mass, their environment, and the amount of thermal energy they possess, which in turn is a function of temperature. This movement accounts for the diffusion of molecules through whatever medium in which they are localized. A substance will tend to move into any space available to it until it is evenly distributed throughout it. After a substance has diffused completely through a space, removing its concentration gradient, molecules will still move around in the space, but there will be no&nbsp;<em>net</em> movement of the number of molecules from one area to another. This lack of a concentration gradient in which there is no net movement of a substance is known as dynamic equilibrium. While diffusion will go forward in the presence of a concentration gradient of a substance, several factors affect the rate of diffusion.</p> <ul><li>Extent of the concentration gradient: The greater the difference in concentration, the more rapid the diffusion. The closer the distribution of the material gets to equilibrium, the slower the rate of diffusion becomes.</li> <li>Mass of the molecules diffusing: Heavier molecules move more slowly; therefore, they diffuse more slowly. The reverse is true for lighter molecules.</li> <li>Temperature: Higher temperatures increase the energy and therefore the movement of the molecules, increasing the rate of diffusion. Lower temperatures decrease the energy of the molecules, thus decreasing the rate of diffusion.</li> <li>Solvent density: As the density of a solvent increases, the rate of diffusion decreases. The molecules slow down because they have a more difficult time getting through the denser medium. If the medium is less dense, diffusion increases. Because cells primarily use diffusion to move materials within the cytoplasm, any increase in the cytoplasm’s density will inhibit the movement of the materials. An example of this is a person experiencing dehydration. As the body’s cells lose water, the rate of diffusion decreases in the cytoplasm, and the cells’ functions deteriorate. Neurons tend to be very sensitive to this effect. Dehydration frequently leads to unconsciousness and possibly coma because of the decrease in diffusion rate within the cells.</li> <li>Solubility: As discussed earlier, nonpolar or lipid-soluble materials pass through plasma membranes more easily than polar materials, allowing a faster rate of diffusion.</li> <li>Surface area and thickness of the plasma membrane: Increased surface area increases the rate of diffusion, whereas a thicker membrane reduces it.</li> <li>Distance travelled: The greater the distance that a substance must travel, the slower the rate of diffusion. This places an upper limitation on cell size. A large, spherical cell will die because nutrients or waste cannot reach or leave the center of the cell, respectively. Therefore, cells must either be small in size, as in the case of many prokaryotes, or be flattened, as with many single-celled eukaryotes.</li> </ul> <p>A variation of diffusion is the process of filtration. In filtration, material moves according to its concentration gradient through a membrane; sometimes the rate of diffusion is enhanced by pressure, causing the substances to filter more rapidly. This occurs in the kidney, where blood pressure forces large amounts of water and accompanying dissolved substances, or solutes, out of the blood and into the renal tubules. The rate of diffusion in this instance is almost totally dependent on pressure. One of the effects of high blood pressure is the appearance of protein in the urine, which is “squeezed through” by the abnormally high pressure.</p> <h3>Facilitated Transport</h3> <p>In facilitated transport, also called facilitated diffusion, materials diffuse across the plasma membrane with the help of membrane proteins. A concentration gradient exists that would allow these materials to diffuse into the cell without expending cellular energy. However, these materials are ions or&nbsp;polar molecules that are repelled by the hydrophobic parts of the cell membrane. Facilitated transport proteins shield these materials from the repulsive force of the membrane, allowing them to diffuse into the cell.</p> <p>The material being transported is first attached to protein or glycoprotein receptors on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane. This allows the material that is needed by the cell to be removed from the extracellular fluid. The substances are then passed to specific integral proteins that facilitate their passage. Some of these integral proteins are collections of beta pleated sheets that form a pore or channel through the phospholipid bilayer. Others are carrier proteins which bind with the substance and aid its diffusion through the membrane.</p> <h3>Channels</h3> <div id="attachment_1725" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1725" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03191205/Figure_05_02_041.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a small substance passing through the pore of a protein channel that is embedded in the plasma membrane." width="450" height="437" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03191205/Figure_05_02_041.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03191205/Figure_05_02_041-300x291.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03191205/Figure_05_02_041-65x63.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03191205/Figure_05_02_041-225x218.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03191205/Figure_05_02_041-350x340.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4. Facilitated transport moves substances down their concentration gradients. They may cross the plasma membrane with the aid of channel proteins. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)</p> </div> <p>The integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are collectively referred to as <strong>transport proteins</strong>, and they function as either channels for the material or carriers. In both cases, they are transmembrane proteins. Channels are specific for the substance that is being transported. <strong>Channel proteins</strong> have hydrophilic domains exposed to the intracellular and extracellular fluids; they additionally have a hydrophilic channel through their core that provides a hydrated opening through the membrane layers (Figure 4). Passage through the channel allows polar compounds to avoid the nonpolar central layer of the plasma membrane that would otherwise slow or prevent their entry into the cell. <strong>Aquaporins</strong> are channel proteins that allow water to pass through the membrane at a very high rate.</p> <p>Channel proteins are either open at all times or they are “gated,” which controls the opening of the channel. The attachment of a particular ion to the channel protein may control the opening, or other mechanisms or substances may be involved. In some tissues, sodium and chloride ions pass freely through open channels, whereas in other tissues a gate must be opened to allow passage. An example of this occurs in the kidney, where both forms of channels are found in different parts of the renal tubules. Cells involved in the transmission of electrical impulses, such as nerve and muscle cells, have gated channels for sodium, potassium, and calcium in their membranes. Opening and closing of these channels changes the relative concentrations on opposing sides of the membrane of these ions, resulting in the facilitation of electrical transmission along membranes (in the case of nerve cells) or in muscle contraction (in the case of muscle cells).</p> <h3>Carrier Proteins</h3> <p>Another type of protein embedded in the plasma membrane is a&nbsp;<strong>carrier protein</strong>. This aptly named protein binds a substance and, in doing so, triggers a change of its own shape, moving the bound molecule from the outside of the cell to its interior (Figure 5); depending on the gradient, the material may move in the opposite direction. Carrier proteins are typically specific for a single substance. This selectivity adds to the overall selectivity of the plasma membrane. The exact mechanism for the change of shape is poorly understood. Proteins can change shape when their hydrogen bonds are affected, but this may not fully explain this mechanism. Each carrier protein is specific to one substance, and there are a finite number of these proteins in any membrane. This can cause problems in transporting enough of the material for the cell to function properly. When all of the proteins are bound to their ligands, they are saturated and the rate of transport is at its maximum. Increasing the concentration gradient at this point will not result in an increased rate of transport.</p> <div id="attachment_1726" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1726" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03191335/Figure_05_02_051.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a carrier protein embedded in the membrane with an opening that initially faces the extracellular surface.

Some substances are able to move down their concentration gradient across the plasma membrane with the aid of carrier proteins. Carrier proteins change shape as they move molecules across the membrane. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)</p> </div> <p>An example of this process occurs in the kidney. Glucose, water, salts, ions, and amino acids needed by the body are filtered in one part of the kidney. This filtrate, which includes glucose, is then reabsorbed in another part of the kidney. Because there are only a finite number of carrier proteins for glucose, if more glucose is present than the proteins can handle, the excess is not transported and it is excreted from the body in the urine. In a diabetic individual, this is described as “spilling glucose into the urine.” A different group of carrier proteins called glucose transport proteins, or GLUTs, are involved in transporting glucose and other hexose sugars through plasma membranes within the body.</p> <p>Channel and carrier proteins transport material at different rates. Channel proteins transport much more quickly than do carrier proteins. Channel proteins facilitate diffusion at a rate of tens of millions of molecules per second, whereas carrier proteins work at a rate of a thousand to a million molecules per second.</p> <h3>Osmosis</h3> <p>Osmosis is the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the concentration gradient of water across the membrane, which is inversely proportional to the concentration of solutes. While diffusion transports material across membranes and within cells, osmosis transports&nbsp;<em>only water</em> across a membrane and the membrane limits the diffusion of solutes in the water. Not surprisingly, the aquaporins that facilitate water movement play a large role in osmosis, most prominently in red blood cells and the membranes of kidney tubules.</p> <h3>Mechanism</h3> <div id="attachment_1727" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1727" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03191430/Figure_05_02_061.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a container whose contents are separated by a semipermeable membrane.

As a result of osmosis, the water level is higher on this side of the membrane, and the solute concentration is the same on both sides." width="400" height="226" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03191430/Figure_05_02_061.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03191430/Figure_05_02_061-300x170.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03191430/Figure_05_02_061-65x37.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03191430/Figure_05_02_061-225x127.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03191430/Figure_05_02_061-350x198.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 6. In osmosis, water always moves from an area of higher water concentration to one of lower concentration. In the diagram shown, the solute cannot pass through the selectively permeable membrane, but the water can.</p> </div> <p>Osmosis is a special case of diffusion. Water, like other substances, moves from an area of high concentration to one of low concentration. An obvious question is what makes water move at all? Imagine a beaker with a semipermeable membrane separating the two sides or halves (Figure 6). On both sides of the membrane the water level is the same, but there are different concentrations of a dissolved substance, or <strong>solute</strong>, that cannot cross the membrane (otherwise the concentrations on each side would be balanced by the solute crossing the membrane). If the volume of the solution on both sides of the membrane is the same, but the concentrations of solute are different, then there are different amounts of water, the solvent, on either side of the membrane.</p> <p>To illustrate this, imagine two full glasses of water. One has a single teaspoon of sugar in it, whereas the second one contains one-quarter cup of sugar. If the total volume of the solutions in both cups is the same, which cup contains more water? Because the large amount of sugar in the second cup takes up much more space than the teaspoon of sugar in the first cup, the first cup has more water in it.</p> <p>Returning to the beaker example, recall that it has a mixture of solutes on either side of the membrane. A principle of diffusion is that the molecules move around and will spread evenly throughout the medium if they can. However, only the material capable of getting through the membrane will diffuse through it. In this example, the solute cannot diffuse through the membrane, but the water can. Water has a concentration gradient in this system. Thus, water will diffuse down its concentration gradient, crossing the membrane to the side where it is less concentrated. This diffusion of water through the membrane—osmosis—will continue until the concentration gradient of water goes to zero or until the hydrostatic pressure of the water balances the osmotic pressure. Osmosis proceeds constantly in living systems.</p> <h3>Tonicity</h3> <p><strong>Tonicity</strong> describes how an extracellular solution can change the volume of a cell by affecting osmosis. A solution’s tonicity often directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution. <strong>Osmolarity</strong> describes the total solute concentration of the solution. A solution with low osmolarity has a greater number of water molecules relative to the number of solute particles; a solution with high osmolarity has fewer water molecules with respect to solute particles. In a situation in which solutions of two different osmolarities are separated by a membrane permeable to water, though not to the solute, water will move from the side of the membrane with lower osmolarity (and more water) to the side with higher osmolarity (and less water). This effect makes sense if you remember that the solute cannot move across the membrane, and thus the only component in the system that can move—the water—moves along its own concentration gradient. An important distinction that concerns living systems is that osmolarity measures the number of particles (which may be molecules) in a solution. Therefore, a solution that is cloudy with cells may have a lower osmolarity than a solution that is clear, if the second solution contains more dissolved molecules than there are cells.</p> <h3>Hypotonic Solutions</h3> <p>Three terms—hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic—are used to relate the osmolarity of a cell to the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid that contains the cells. In a hypotonic situation, the extracellular fluid has lower osmolarity than the fluid inside the cell, and water enters the cell. (In living systems, the point of reference is always the cytoplasm, so the prefix&nbsp;<em>hypo</em>– means that the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes, or a lower osmolarity, than the cell cytoplasm.) It also means that the extracellular fluid has a higher concentration of water in the solution than does the cell. In this situation, water will follow its concentration gradient and enter the cell.</p> <h3>Hypertonic Solutions</h3> <p>As for a hypertonic solution, the prefix&nbsp;<em>hyper</em>– refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher osmolarity than the cell’s cytoplasm; therefore, the fluid contains less water than the cell does. Because the cell has a relatively higher concentration of water, water will leave the cell.</p> <h3>Isotonic Solutions</h3> <p>In an isotonic solution, the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the cell. If the osmolarity of the cell matches that of the extracellular fluid, there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell, although water will still move in and out. Blood cells and plant cells (Figure 7) in hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic solutions take on characteristic appearances.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <div id="attachment_4531" style="width: 2175px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-4531" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/03/23200628/Figure_05_02_08ab1.jpg" alt="Part a: osmotic pressure.

<div id="q619831" class="hidden-answer" style="display: none">No, it must have been hypotonic as a hypotonic solution would cause water to enter the cells, thereby making them burst.</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Tonicity in Living Systems</h3>
<p>In a hypotonic environment, water enters a cell, and the cell swells. In an isotonic condition, the relative concentrations of solute and solvent are equal on both sides of the membrane. There is no net water movement; therefore, there is no change in the size of the cell. In a hypertonic solution, water leaves a cell and the cell shrinks. If either the hypo- or hyper- condition goes to excess, the cell’s functions become compromised, and the cell may be destroyed.</p>
<p>A red blood cell will burst, or lyse, when it swells beyond the plasma membrane’s capability to expand. Remember, the membrane resembles a mosaic, with discrete spaces between the molecules composing it. If the cell swells, and the spaces between the lipids and proteins become too large, the cell will break apart.</p>
<p>In contrast, when excessive amounts of water leave a red blood cell, the cell shrinks, or crenates. This has the effect of concentrating the solutes left in the cell, making the cytosol denser and interfering with diffusion within the cell. The cell’s ability to function will be compromised and may also result in the death of the cell.</p>
<p>Various living things have ways of controlling the effects of osmosis—a mechanism called osmoregulation. Some organisms, such as plants, fungi, bacteria, and some protists, have cell walls that surround the plasma membrane and prevent cell lysis in a hypotonic solution. The plasma membrane can only expand to the limit of the cell wall, so the cell will not lyse. In fact, the cytoplasm in plants is always slightly hypertonic to the cellular environment, and water will always enter a cell if water is available. This inflow of water produces turgor pressure, which stiffens the cell walls of the plant (Figure 7). In nonwoody plants, turgor pressure supports the plant. Conversly, if the plant is not watered, the extracellular fluid will become hypertonic, causing water to leave the cell. In this condition, the cell does not shrink because the cell wall is not flexible. However, the cell membrane detaches from the wall and constricts the cytoplasm. This is called plasmolysis. Plants lose turgor pressure in this condition and wilt (Figure 8).</p>

<p>Tonicity is a concern for all living things. For example, paramecia and amoebas, which are protists that lack cell walls, have contractile vacuoles. This vesicle collects excess water from the cell and pumps it out, keeping the cell from lysing as it takes on water from its environment (Figure 9).</p>
<p>Many marine invertebrates have internal salt levels matched to their environments, making them isotonic with the water in which they live. Fish, however, must spend approximately five percent of their metabolic energy maintaining osmotic homeostasis. Freshwater fish live in an environment that is hypotonic to their cells. These fish actively take in salt through their gills and excrete diluted urine to rid themselves of excess water. Saltwater fish live in the reverse environment, which is hypertonic to their cells, and they secrete salt through their gills and excrete highly concentrated urine.</p>
<p>In vertebrates, the kidneys regulate the amount of water in the body. Osmoreceptors are specialized cells in the brain that monitor the concentration of solutes in the blood. If the levels of solutes increase beyond a certain range, a hormone is released that retards water loss through the kidney and dilutes the blood to safer levels. Animals also have high concentrations of albumin, which is produced by the liver, in their blood. This protein is too large to pass easily through plasma membranes and is a major factor in controlling the osmotic pressures applied to tissues.</p>

<h2>Active Transport</h2>
<p><strong>Active transport </strong>mechanisms require the use of the cell’s energy, usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). If a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient—that is, if the concentration of the substance inside the cell is greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid (and vice versa)—the cell must use energy to move the substance. Some active transport mechanisms move small-molecular weight materials, such as ions, through the membrane. Other mechanisms transport much larger molecules.</p>
<h3>Electrochemical Gradient</h3>
<p>We have discussed simple concentration gradients—differential concentrations of a substance across a space or a membrane—but in living systems, gradients are more complex. Because ions move into and out of cells and because cells contain proteins that do not move across the membrane and are mostly negatively charged, there is also an electrical gradient, a difference of charge, across the plasma membrane. The interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect to the extracellular fluid in which they are bathed, and at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) and lower concentrations of sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) than does the extracellular fluid. So in a living cell, the concentration gradient of Na<sup>+</sup> tends to drive it into the cell, and the electrical gradient of Na<sup>+&nbsp;</sup>(a positive ion) also tends to drive it inward to the negatively charged interior. The situation is more complex, however, for other elements such as potassium. The electrical gradient of K<sup>+</sup>, a positive ion, also tends to drive it into the cell, but the concentration gradient of K<sup>+</sup> tends to drive K<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;<em>out</em> of the cell (Figure 1). The combined gradient of concentration and electrical charge that affects an ion is called its <strong>electrochemical gradient</strong>.</p>

<p>Injection of a potassium solution into a person’s blood is lethal; this is used in capital punishment and euthanasia. Why do you think a potassium solution injection is lethal?</p>
<p><textarea rows="2" cols="50"></textarea></p> <div class="qa-wrapper" style="display: block"><span class="show-answer collapsed" style="cursor: pointer" data-target="q900539"><strong>Show Answer</strong></span> <div id="q900539" class="hidden-answer" style="display: none">Cells typically have a high concentration of potassium in the cytoplasm and are bathed in a high concentration of sodium. Injection of potassium dissipates this electrochemical gradient. In heart muscle, the sodium/potassium potential is responsible for transmitting the signal that causes the muscle to contract. When this potential is dissipated, the signal can’t be transmitted, and the heart stops beating. Potassium injections are also used to stop the heart from beating during surgery.</div> </div> </div> <h3>Moving Against a Gradient</h3> <p>To move substances against a concentration or electrochemical gradient, the cell must use energy. This energy is harvested from ATP generated through the cell’s metabolism. Active transport mechanisms, collectively called&nbsp;<strong>pumps</strong>, work against electrochemical gradients. Small substances constantly pass through plasma membranes. Active transport maintains concentrations of ions and other substances needed by living cells in the face of these passive movements. Much of a cell’s supply of metabolic energy may be spent maintaining these processes. (Most of a red blood cell’s metabolic energy is used to maintain the imbalance between exterior and interior sodium and potassium levels required by the cell.) Because active transport mechanisms depend on a cell’s metabolism for energy, they are sensitive to many metabolic poisons that interfere with the supply of ATP.</p> <p>Two mechanisms exist for the transport of small-molecular weight material and small molecules.&nbsp;<strong>Primary active transport</strong> moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane, which is directly dependent on ATP. <strong>Secondary active transport</strong> describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require ATP.</p> <h3>Carrier Proteins for Active Transport</h3> <p>An important membrane adaption for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps to facilitate movement: there are three types of these proteins or&nbsp;<strong>transporters</strong> (Figure 2). A <strong>uniporter</strong> carries one specific ion or molecule. A <strong>symporter</strong> carries two different ions or molecules, both in the same direction. An <strong>antiporter</strong> also carries two different ions or molecules, but in different directions. All of these transporters can also transport small, uncharged organic molecules like glucose. These three types of carrier proteins are also found in facilitated diffusion, but they do not require ATP to work in that process. Some examples of pumps for active transport are Na<sup>+–</sup>K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, which carries sodium and potassium ions, and H<sup>+–</sup>K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, which carries hydrogen and potassium ions. Both of these are antiporter carrier proteins. Two other carrier proteins are Ca2<sup>+</sup> ATPase and H<sup>+</sup> ATPase, which carry only calcium and only hydrogen ions, respectively. Both are pumps.</p> <div id="attachment_1733" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1733" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03192119/Figure_05_03_021.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a plasma membrane with three transport proteins embedded in it.

Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient (electrogenic transport). (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)</p> </div> <p>One of the most important pumps in animals cells is the sodium-potassium pump (Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase), which maintains the electrochemical gradient (and the correct concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>) in living cells. The sodium-potassium pump moves K<sup>+</sup> into the cell while moving Na+ out at the same time, at a ratio of three Na<sup>+</sup> for every two K<sup>+</sup> ions moved in. The Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase exists in two forms, depending on its orientation to the interior or exterior of the cell and its affinity for either sodium or potassium ions. The process consists of the following six steps.</p> <ol><li>With the enzyme oriented towards the interior of the cell, the carrier has a high affinity for sodium ions. Three ions bind to the protein.</li> <li>ATP is hydrolyzed by the protein carrier and a low-energy phosphate group attaches to it.</li> <li>As a result, the carrier changes shape and re-orients itself towards the exterior of the membrane. The protein’s affinity for sodium decreases and the three sodium ions leave the carrier.</li> <li>The shape change increases the carrier’s affinity for potassium ions, and two such ions attach to the protein. Subsequently, the low-energy phosphate group detaches from the carrier.</li> <li>With the phosphate group removed and potassium ions attached, the carrier protein repositions itself towards the interior of the cell.</li> <li>The carrier protein, in its new configuration, has a decreased affinity for potassium, and the two ions are released into the cytoplasm. The protein now has a higher affinity for sodium ions, and the process starts again.</li> </ol> <p>Several things have happened as a result of this process. At this point, there are more sodium ions outside of the cell than inside and more potassium ions inside than out. For every three ions of sodium that move out, two ions of potassium move in. This results in the interior being slightly more negative relative to the exterior. This difference in charge is important in creating the conditions necessary for the secondary process. The sodium-potassium pump is, therefore, an electrogenic pump (a pump that creates a charge imbalance), creating an electrical imbalance across the membrane and contributing to the membrane potential.</p> <h3>Secondary Active Transport (Co-transport)</h3> <p>Secondary active transport brings sodium ions, and possibly other compounds, into the cell. As sodium ion concentrations build outside of the plasma membrane because of the action of the primary active transport process, an electrochemical gradient is created. If a channel protein exists and is open, the sodium ions will be pulled through the membrane. This movement is used to transport other substances that can attach themselves to the transport protein through the membrane (Figure 4). Many amino acids, as well as glucose, enter a cell this way. This secondary process is also used to store high-energy hydrogen ions in the mitochondria of plant and animal cells for the production of ATP. The potential energy that accumulates in the stored hydrogen ions is translated into kinetic energy as the ions surge through the channel protein ATP synthase, and that energy is used to convert ADP into ATP.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <p>An electrochemical gradient, created by primary active transport, can move other substances against their concentration gradients, a process called co-transport or secondary active transport.</p> <div id="attachment_1735" style="width: 735px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1735" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03192351/Figure_05_03_041.png" alt="This illustration shows a membrane bilayer with two integral membrane proteins embedded in it.

In phagocytosis, the cell membrane surrounds the particle and engulfs it. (credit: Mariana Ruiz Villareal)</p> </div> <p>Phagocytosis (the condition of “cell eating”) is the process by which large particles, such as cells or relatively large particles, are taken in by a cell. For example, when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil will remove the invaders through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then destroyed by the neutrophil (Figure 1).</p> <p>In preparation for phagocytosis, a portion of the inward-facing surface of the plasma membrane becomes coated with a protein called <em>clathrin</em>, which stabilizes this section of the membrane. The coated portion of the membrane then extends from the body of the cell and surrounds the particle, eventually enclosing it. Once the vesicle containing the particle is enclosed within the cell, the clathrin disengages from the membrane and the vesicle merges with a lysosome for the breakdown of the material in the newly formed compartment (endosome). When accessible nutrients from the degradation of the vesicular contents have been extracted, the newly formed endosome merges with the plasma membrane and releases its contents into the extracellular fluid. The endosomal membrane again becomes part of the plasma membrane.</p> <h3>Pinocytosis</h3> <div id="attachment_4405" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-4405" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/02/01233450/Figure_05_04_02.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a plasma membrane forming a pocket around fluid in the extracellular fluid.

In pinocytosis, the cell membrane invaginates, surrounds a small volume of fluid, and pinches off. (credit: Mariana Ruiz Villareal)</p> </div> <p>A variation of endocytosis is called pinocytosis. This literally means “cell drinking” and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. In reality, this is a process that takes in molecules, including water, which the cell needs from the extracellular fluid. Pinocytosis results in a much smaller vesicle than does phagocytosis, and the vesicle does not need to merge with a lysosome (Figure 2).</p> <p>A variation of pinocytosis is called potocytosis. This process uses a coating protein, called caveolin, on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, which performs a similar function to clathrin. The cavities in the plasma membrane that form the vacuoles have membrane receptors and lipid rafts in addition to caveolin.</p> <p>The vacuoles or vesicles formed in caveolae (singular caveola) are smaller than those in pinocytosis. Potocytosis is used to bring small molecules into the cell and to transport these molecules through the cell for their release on the other side of the cell, a process called transcytosis.</p> <h3>Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis</h3> <div id="attachment_4406" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-4406" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/02/01234001/Figure_05_04_03ab.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a part of the plasma membrane that is clathrin-coated on the cytoplasmic side and has receptors on the extracellular side.

In receptor-mediated endocytosis, uptake of substances by the cell is targeted to a single type of substance that binds to the receptor on the external surface of the cell membrane. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)</p> </div> <p>A targeted variation of endocytosis employs receptor proteins in the plasma membrane that have a specific binding affinity for certain substances (Figure 3).</p> <p>In receptor-mediated endocytosis, as in phagocytosis, clathrin is attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. If uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor-mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective, the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration.</p> <p>Some human diseases are caused by the failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as “bad” cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear LDL particles from their blood.</p> <p>Although receptor-mediated endocytosis is designed to bring specific substances that are normally found in the extracellular fluid into the cell, other substances may gain entry into the cell at the same site. Flu viruses, diphtheria, and cholera toxin all have sites that cross-react with normal receptor-binding sites and gain entry into cells.</p> <h2>Exocytosis</h2> <p>The reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis. Exocytosis is the opposite of the processes discussed in the last&nbsp;section&nbsp;in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid. Waste material is enveloped in a membrane and fuses with the interior of the plasma membrane. This fusion opens the membranous envelope on the exterior of the cell, and the waste material is expelled into the extracellular space (Figure 4). Other examples of cells releasing molecules via exocytosis include the secretion of proteins of the extracellular matrix and secretion of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft by synaptic vesicles.</p> <div id="attachment_1634" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1634" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02232844/Figure_05_04_04.jpg" alt="This illustration shows vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane and releasing their contents to the extracellular fluid." width="500" height="567" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02232844/Figure_05_04_04.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02232844/Figure_05_04_04-265x300.jpg 265w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02232844/Figure_05_04_04-65x74.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02232844/Figure_05_04_04-225x255.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02232844/Figure_05_04_04-350x397.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a defect in a single transmembrane protein: cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), as seen in Figure 1. This regulator is a chloride ion channel that crosses through the plasma membrane. This channel is specifically active in epithelial tissues where it normally helps produce thin mucus via the movement of water. When mutated, the channel does not work properly and mucus becomes thick and viscous. This in turn leads directly to many of the symptoms of CF: thick, sticky mucus, frequent chest infections, and coughing or shortness of breath.</p> <div id="attachment_4046" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-4046" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/04210104/512px-CFTR_Protein_Panels.svg_.png" alt="The CFTR protein is a channel protein that controls the flow of H2O and Cl- ions into and out of cells inside the lungs.

Panel 1 shows a properly working CFTR protein. Panel 2 shows a malfunctioning CFTR protein.</p> </div> <h2>Treatment</h2> <p>Cystic fibrosis is a difficult disease to treat. As we mentioned at the beginning of the module, patients with CF often suffer lung infections and sometimes require lung transplants. In addition to this, many CF patients are on one or more antibiotics at all times—even when healthy—to suppress infection. Several mechanical techniques are used to dislodge sputum and encourage its expectoration. In the hospital setting, chest physiotherapy is utilized. As lung disease worsens, mechanical breathing support may become necessary. Bi-lateral lung transplantation often becomes necessary for individuals with cystic fibrosis as lung function and exercise tolerance declines.</p> <p>Gene therapy has been explored as a potential cure for cystic fibrosis. Ideally, gene therapy attempts to place a normal copy of the CFTR gene into affected cells. Transferring the normal CFTR gene into the affected epithelium cells would result in the production of functional CFTR in all target cells, without adverse reactions or an inflammation response. Studies have shown that to prevent the lung manifestations of cystic fibrosis, only 5–10 percent the normal amount of CFTR gene expression is needed.</p> <p>Finally, a number of small molecules that aim at compensating various mutations of the CFTR gene are under development. About 10 percent of CF cases result from a premature stop codon in the DNA, leading to early termination of protein synthesis and truncated proteins. One approach to combating a faulty receptor is to develop drugs that get the ribosome to overcome this premature stop codon and synthesize a full-length CFTR protein.</p> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>Learn More</h3> <ul><li><a href="http://www.cff.org/" target="_blank">Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystic-fibrosis/basics/causes/con-20013731" target="_blank">Cystic Fibrosis on the Mayo Clinic</a></li> </ul> </div> </div><div class="licensing"><div class="license-attribution-dropdown-subheading">CC licensed content, Original</div><ul class="citation-list"><li>Revision and Modification. <strong>Authored by</strong>: Shelli Carter and Lumen Learning. <strong>Provided by</strong>: Lumen Learning. <strong>License</strong>: <em><a target="_blank" rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA: Attribution-ShareAlike</a></em></li></ul><div class="license-attribution-dropdown-subheading">CC licensed content, Shared previously</div><ul class="citation-list"><li>Cystic Fibrosis. <strong>Provided by</strong>: Boundless. <strong>Located at</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.boundless.com/physiology/textbooks/boundless-anatomy-and-physiology-textbook/appendix-a-diseases-injuries-and-disorders-of-the-organ-systems-1416/respiratory-diseases-and-disorders-1464/cystic-fibrosis-1467-10141/">https://www.boundless.com/physiology/textbooks/boundless-anatomy-and-physiology-textbook/appendix-a-diseases-injuries-and-disorders-of-the-organ-systems-1416/respiratory-diseases-and-disorders-1464/cystic-fibrosis-1467-10141/</a>. <strong>License</strong>: <em><a target="_blank" rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA: Attribution-ShareAlike</a></em></li><li>CFTR Protein Panels. <strong>Authored by</strong>: Lbudd14. <strong>Located at</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CFTR_Protein_Panels.svg">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CFTR_Protein_Panels.svg</a>. <strong>License</strong>: <em><a target="_blank" rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA: Attribution-ShareAlike</a></em></li></ul></div>

Most of these pathways are combinations of oxidation and reduction reactions. Oxidation and reduction occur in tandem. An oxidation reaction strips an electron from an atom in a compound, and the addition of this electron to another compound is a reduction reaction. Because oxidation and reduction usually occur together, these pairs of reactions are called oxidation reduction reactions, or&nbsp;<strong>redox reactions</strong>.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>Learning Objectives</h3> <ul><li>Relate the movement of electrons to oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions</li> <li>Describe how cells store and transfer free energy using ATP</li> </ul> </div> <h2>&nbsp;Electrons and Energy</h2> <p>Let’s imagine that you are a cell. You’ve just been given a big, juicy glucose molecule, and you’d like to convert some of the energy in this glucose molecule into a more usable form, one that you can use to power your metabolic reactions. How can you go about this? What’s the best way for you to squeeze as much energy as possible out of that glucose molecule, and to capture this energy in a handy form?</p> <p>Fortunately for us, our cells—and those of other living organisms—are excellent at harvesting energy from glucose and other organic molecules, such as fats and amino acids. Here, we’ll go through a quick overview of how cells break down fuels, then look at the electron transfer reactions (redox reactions) that are key to this process.</p> <h3>Overview of fuel breakdown pathways</h3> <p>The reactions that allow energy to be extracted from molecules such as glucose, fats, and amino acids are called <strong>catabolic reactions</strong>, meaning that they involve breaking a larger molecule into smaller pieces. For example, when glucose is broken down in the presence of oxygen, it’s converted into six carbon dioxide molecules and six water molecules. The overall reaction for this process can be written as:</p> <p style="text-align: center;">[latex]\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6+6\text{O}_2\to{6}\text{CO}_2+6\text{H}_2\text{O}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\Delta{G}=-686\text{kcal/mol}[/latex]</p> <p>This reaction, as written, is simply a combustion reaction, similar to what takes place when you burn a piece of wood in a fireplace or gasoline in an engine. Does this mean that glucose is continually combusting inside of your cells? Thankfully, not quite! The combustion reaction describes the overall process that takes place, but inside of a cell, this process is broken down into many smaller steps. Energy contained in the bonds of glucose is released in small bursts, and some of it can be captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a small molecule that is used to power reactions in the cell. Much of the energy from glucose is still lost as heat, but enough is captured to keep the metabolism of the cell running.</p> <p>As a glucose molecule is gradually broken down, some of the breakdowns steps release energy that is captured directly as ATP. In these steps, a phosphate group is transferred from a pathway intermediate straight to ADP, a process known as <strong>substrate-level phosphorylation</strong>. Many more steps, however, produce ATP in an indirect way. In these steps, electrons from glucose are transferred to small molecules known as electron carriers. The electron carriers take the electrons to a group of proteins in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion, called the electron transport chain. As electrons move through the electron transport chain, they go from a higher to a lower energy level and are ultimately passed to oxygen (forming water). Energy released in the electron transport chain is captured as a proton gradient, which powers production of ATP by a membrane protein called ATP synthase. This process is known as <strong>oxidative phosphorylation</strong>. A simplified diagram of oxidative and substrate-level phosphorylation is shown below.</p> <div id="attachment_2478" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-2478" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/01210311/oxidateive-1024x680.png" alt="Simplified diagram showing oxidative phosphorylation and substrate-level phosphorylation during glucose breakdown reactions. Inside the matrix of the mitochondrion, substrate-level phosphorylation takes place when a phosphate group from an intermediate of the glucose breakdown reactions is transferred to ADP, forming ATP. At the same time, electrons are transported from intermediates of the glucose breakdown reactions to the electron transport chain by electron carriers. The electrons move through the electron transport chain, pumping protons into the intermembrane space. When these protons flow back down their concentration gradient, they pass through ATP synthase, which uses the electron flow to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This process of electron transport, proton pumping, and capture of energy from the proton gradient to make ATP is called oxidative phosphorylation." width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/01210311/oxidateive-1024x680.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/01210311/oxidateive-300x199.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/01210311/oxidateive-768x510.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/01210311/oxidateive-65x43.png 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/01210311/oxidateive-225x149.png 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/01210311/oxidateive-350x233.png 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1.

Most eukaryotic cells, as well as many bacteria and other prokaryotes, can carry out aerobic respiration. Some prokaryotes have pathways similar to aerobic respiration, but with a different inorganic molecule, such as sulfur, substituted for oxygen. These pathways are not oxygen-dependent, so the breakdown process is called <strong>anaerobic respiration&nbsp;</strong>(anaerobic = non-oxygen-requiring). Officially, both processes are examples of <strong>cellular respiration</strong>, the breakdown of down organic fuels using an electron transport chain. However, cellular respiration is commonly used as a synonym for aerobic respiration, and we’ll use it that way here<span class="footnote">Reece, J. B., Urry, L. A., Cain, M. L., Wasserman, S. A., Minorsky, P. V., and Jackson, R. B. (2011). Cellular respiration and fermentation. In <em>Campbell biology</em> (10th ed., pp. 162–184). San Francisco, CA: Pearson.</span>.</p> <h3>Redox Reactions</h3> <p>Cellular respiration involves many reactions in which electrons are passed from one molecule to another. Reactions involving electron transfers are known as <strong>oxidation-reduction reactions</strong> (or <strong>redox reactions</strong>), and they play a central role in the metabolism of a cell. In a redox reaction, one of the reacting molecules loses electrons and is said to be <strong>oxidized</strong>, while another reacting molecule gains electrons (the ones lost by the first molecule) and is said to be&nbsp;<strong>reduced</strong>. You can remember what oxidation and reduction mean with the handy mnemonic “LEO goes GER”: <em>L</em>ose <em>E</em>lectrons, <em>O</em>xidized; <em>G</em>ain <em>E</em>lectrons,<em>R</em>educed. The formation of magnesium chloride is one simple example of a redox reaction:</p> <p style="text-align: center;">[latex]\text{Mg}+\text{Cl}_2\to\text{Mg}^{2+}+2\text{Cl}^{-}[/latex]</p> <p>In this reaction, the magnesium atom loses two electrons, so it is oxidized. These two electrons are accepted by chlorine, which is reduced. The atom or molecule that donates electrons (in this case, magnesium) is called the&nbsp;<strong>reducing agent</strong>, because its donation of electrons allows another molecule to become reduced. The atom or molecule that accepts the electrons (in this case, chlorine) is known as the <strong>oxidizing agent</strong>, because its acceptance of electrons allows the other molecule to become oxidized.</p> <h3>Redox reactions with carbon-containing molecules</h3> <p>When a reaction involves the formation of ions, as in the example with magnesium and chlorine above, it’s relatively easy to see that electrons are being transferred. Not all redox reactions involve the complete transfer of electrons, though, and this is particularly true of reactions important in cellular metabolism. Instead, some redox reactions simply change the amount of electron density on a particular atom by altering how it shares electrons in covalent bonds. As an example, let’s consider the combustion of butane:</p> <div id="attachment_2479" style="width: 611px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2479" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/01210503/butane.png" alt="Chemical reaction for butane combustion with diagrams of the molecules involved." width="601" height="172" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/01210503/butane.png 500w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/01210503/butane-300x86.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/01210503/butane-65x19.png 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/01210503/butane-225x64.png 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/01210503/butane-350x100.png 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2. Butane: [latex]2\text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}+13\text{O}_2\to8\text{CO}_2+10\text{H}_2\text{O}[/latex]</p> </div> <p>What’s the electron-sharing situation at the start of the reaction? In butane, the carbon atoms are all bonded to other carbons and hydrogens. In [latex]\text{C}-\text{C}[/latex] bonds, electrons are shared equally, and in [latex]\text{C}-\text{H}[/latex] bonds, the [latex]\text{C}[/latex] atom has a very slight negative charge (since it’s a bit more electronegative than hydrogen). Similarly, when oxygens are bonded to one another in [latex]\text{O}_2[/latex], start subscript, 2, end subscript, electrons are shared very equally. After the reaction, however, the electron-sharing picture looks quite different. Oxygen is much more electronegative than carbon, so the in the [latex]\text{C}=\text{O}[/latex]&nbsp;bonds of carbon dioxide, oxygen will “hog” the bond electrons. In the [latex]\text{O}-\text{H}[/latex]&nbsp;bonds of water, oxygen will similarly pull electrons away from the hydrogen atoms. Thus, relative to its state before the reaction, carbon has lost electron density (because oxygen is now hogging its electrons), while oxygen has gained electron density (because it can now hog electrons shared with other elements). It’s thus reasonable to say that carbon was oxidized during this reaction, while oxygen was reduced. (Hydrogen arguably loses a little electron density too, though its electrons were being hogged to some degree in either case.) Biologists often refer to whole molecules, rather than individual atoms, as being reduced or oxidized; thus, we can say that butane—the source of the carbons—is oxidized, while molecular oxygen—the source of the oxygen atoms—is reduced.</p> <p>It’s important to understand that oxidation and reduction reactions are fundamentally about the transfer of electrons. In the context of biology, however, you may find it helpful to use the gain or loss of H and O atoms as a proxy for the transfer of electrons. As a general rule of thumb, if a carbon-containing molecule gains H atoms or loses O atoms during a reaction, it’s likely been reduced (gained electrons). Conversely, if it loses H atoms or gains O atoms, it’s probably been oxidized (lost electrons). For example, let’s go back to the reaction for glucose breakdown,[latex]\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6+6\text{O}_2\to{6}\text{CO}_2+6\text{H}_2\text{O}[/latex]. In glucose, carbon is associated with H atoms, while in carbon dioxide, no Hs are present. Thus, we would predict that glucose is oxidized in this reaction.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p>We can confirm this if we look at the actual electron shifts involved, as in the video below:</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_KyyVhlUDNU/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &quot;Oxidation and reduction in cellular respiration | Biology | Khan Academy&quot;" title="Oxidation and reduction in cellular respiration | Biology | Khan Academy" /> <p>A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Click on the image for a larger view. Image based on similar diagram by Ryan Gutierrez.</p> </div> <p>Like other chemical reactions, redox reactions involve a free energy change. Reactions that move the system from a higher to a lower energy state are spontaneous and release energy, while those that do the opposite require an input of energy. In redox reactions, energy is released when an electron loses potential energy as a result of the transfer. Electrons have more potential energy when they are associated with less electronegative atoms (such as C or H), and less potential energy when they are associated with a more electronegative atom (such as O). Thus, a redox reaction that moves electrons or electron density from a less to a more electronegative atom will be spontaneous and release energy. For instance, the combustion of butane (above) releases energy because there is a net shift of electron density away from carbon and hydrogen and onto oxygen. If you’ve heard it said that molecules like glucose have “high-energy” electrons, this is a reference to the relatively high potential energy of the electrons in their [latex]\text{C}-\text{C}[/latex] and [latex]\text{C}-\text{H}[/latex] bonds.</p> <p>Quite a bit of energy can be released when electrons in [latex]\text{C}-\text{C}[/latex] and [latex]\text{C}-\text{H}[/latex]&nbsp;bonds are shifted to oxygen. In a cell, however, it’s not a great idea to release all that energy at once in a combustion reaction. Instead, cells harvest energy from glucose in a controlled fashion, capturing as much of it as possible in the form of ATP. This is accomplished by oxidizing glucose in a gradual, rather than an explosive, sort of way. There are two important ways in which this oxidation is gradual:</p> <ul><li>Rather than pulling all the electrons off of glucose at the same time, cellular respiration strips them away in pairs. The redox reactions that remove electron pairs from glucose transfer them to small molecules called electron carriers.</li> <li>The electron carriers deposit their electrons in the electron transport chain, a series of proteins and organic molecules in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Electrons are passed from one component to the next in a series of energy-releasing steps, allowing energy to be captured in the form of an electrochemical gradient.</li> </ul> <p>We’ll look at both redox carriers and the electron transport chain in more detail below.</p> <p>The removal of an electron from a molecule, oxidizing it, results in a decrease in potential energy in the oxidized compound. The electron (sometimes as part of a hydrogen atom), does not remain unbonded, however, in the cytoplasm of a cell. Rather, the electron is shifted to a second compound, reducing the second compound. The shift of an electron from one compound to another removes some potential energy from the first compound (the oxidized compound) and increases the potential energy of the second compound (the reduced compound). The transfer of electrons between molecules is important because most of the energy stored in atoms and used to fuel cell functions is in the form of high-energy electrons. The transfer of energy in the form of electrons allows the cell to transfer and use energy in an incremental fashion—in small packages rather than in a single, destructive burst. This module focuses on the extraction of energy from food; you will see that as you track the path of the transfers, you are tracking the path of electrons moving through metabolic pathways.</p> <h3>Electron Carriers</h3> <p>Electron carriers, sometimes called electron shuttles, are small organic molecules that readily cycle between oxidized and reduced forms and are used to transport electrons during metabolic reactions. There are two electron carriers that play particularly important roles during cellular respiration: <strong>NAD<sup>+</sup></strong>&nbsp;(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, shown below) and <strong>FAD</strong> (flavin adenine dinucleotide). Both NAD<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;and FAD can serve as oxidizing agents, accepting a pair of electrons, along with one or more protons, to switch to their reduced forms. NAD<sup>+</sup>&nbsp; accepts two electrons and one H<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;to become NADH, while FAD accepts two electrons and two H<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;to become FADH<sub>2</sub>. NAD<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;is the primary electron carrier used during cellular respiration, with FAD participating in just one (or two sometimes two) reactions.</p> <div id="attachment_1740" style="width: 736px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1740" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03192916/Figure_07_01_01ab.jpg" alt="This illustration shows the molecular structure of NAD^{+} and NADH.

In NADH, one extra hydrogen is associated with this ring, which is not found in NAD^{+}." width="726" height="481" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03192916/Figure_07_01_01ab.jpg 726w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03192916/Figure_07_01_01ab-300x199.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03192916/Figure_07_01_01ab-65x43.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03192916/Figure_07_01_01ab-225x149.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03192916/Figure_07_01_01ab-350x232.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4. The oxidized form of the electron carrier (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is shown on the left and the reduced form (NADH) is shown on the right. The nitrogenous base in NADH has one more hydrogen ion and two more electrons than in NAD<sup>+</sup>.</p> </div> <p>As shown in the image above, NAD<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;is a small organic molecule whose structure includes the RNA nucleotide adenine. (FAD is a similar type of molecule, although its functional groups are different.) Both molecules are B vitamin derivatives, with NAD<sup>+</sup> produced from niacin and FAD produced from riboflavin. NAD<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;and FAD are <strong>coenzymes</strong>, organic molecules that serve as helpers during enzyme-catalyzed reactions, and they receive electrons and protons as part of these reactions. Specifically, both NAD<sup>+</sup>&nbsp; and FAD serve as cofactors for enzymes called <strong>dehydrogenases</strong>, which remove one or more hydrogen atoms from their substrates.</p> <h3>The Electron Transport Chain</h3> <p>In their reduced forms, NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;carry electrons to the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. They deposit their electrons at or near the beginning of the transport chain, and the electrons are then passed along from one protein or organic molecule to the next in a predictable series of steps. Importantly, the movement of electrons through the transport chain is energetically “downhill,” such that energy is released at each step. In redox terms, this means that each member of the electron transport chain is more electronegative (electron-hungry) that the one before it, and less electronegative than the one after<span class="footnote"><em>Ibid</em>.</span>. NAD<sup>+</sup>,&nbsp;which deposits its electrons at the beginning of the chain as NADH, is the least electronegative, while oxygen, which receives the electrons at the end of the chain (along with H<sup>+</sup>) to form water, is the most electronegative. As electrons trickle “downhill” through the transport chain, they release energy, and some of this energy is captured in the form of an electrochemical gradient and used to make ATP.</p> <h2>ATP in Living Systems</h2> <p>A living cell cannot store significant amounts of free energy. Excess free energy would result in an increase of heat in the cell, which would result in excessive thermal motion that could damage and then destroy the cell. Rather, a cell must be able to handle that energy in a way that enables the cell to store energy safely and release it for use only as needed. Living cells accomplish this by using the compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is often called the “energy currency” of the cell, and, like currency, this versatile compound can be used to fill any energy need of the cell. How? It functions similarly to a rechargeable battery.</p> <p>When ATP is broken down, usually by the removal of its terminal phosphate group, energy is released. The energy is used to do work by the cell, usually by the released phosphate binding to another molecule, activating it. For example, in the mechanical work of muscle contraction, ATP supplies the energy to move the contractile muscle proteins. Recall the active transport work of the sodium-potassium pump in cell membranes. ATP alters the structure of the integral protein that functions as the pump, changing its affinity for sodium and potassium. In this way, the cell performs work, pumping ions against their electrochemical gradients.</p> <h3>ATP Structure and Function</h3> <div id="attachment_1741" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1741" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03193009/Figure_07_01_02.jpg" alt="This illustration shows the molecular structure of ATP.

The addition of a second phosphate group to this core molecule results in the formation of adenosine&nbsp;diphosphate (ADP); the addition of a third phosphate group forms adenosine triphosphate (ATP).</p> <p>The addition of a phosphate group to a molecule requires energy. Phosphate groups are negatively charged and thus repel one another when they are arranged in series, as they are in ADP and ATP. This repulsion makes the ADP and ATP molecules inherently unstable. The release of one or two phosphate groups from ATP, a process called&nbsp;<strong>dephosphorylation</strong>, releases energy.</p> <h4>Energy from ATP</h4> <p>Hydrolysis is the process of breaking complex macromolecules apart. During hydrolysis, water is split, or lysed, and the resulting hydrogen atom (H<sup>+</sup>) and a hydroxyl group (OH<sup>–</sup>) are added to the larger molecule. The hydrolysis of ATP produces ADP, together with an inorganic phosphate ion (P<sub><em>i</em></sub>), and the release of free energy. To carry out life processes, ATP is continuously broken down into ADP, and like a rechargeable battery, ADP is continuously regenerated into ATP by the reattachment of a third phosphate group. Water, which was broken down into its hydrogen atom and hydroxyl group during ATP hydrolysis, is regenerated when a third phosphate is added to the ADP molecule, reforming ATP.</p> <p>Obviously, energy must be infused into the system to regenerate ATP. Where does this energy come from? In nearly every living thing on earth, the energy comes from the metabolism of glucose. In this way, ATP is a direct link between the limited set of exergonic pathways of glucose catabolism and the multitude of endergonic pathways that power living cells.</p> <h3>Phosphorylation</h3> <p>Recall that, in some chemical reactions, enzymes may bind to several substrates that react with each other on the enzyme, forming an intermediate complex. An intermediate complex is a temporary structure, and it allows one of the substrates (such as ATP) and reactants to more readily react with each other; in reactions involving ATP, ATP is one of the substrates and ADP is a product. During an endergonic chemical reaction, ATP forms an intermediate complex with the substrate and enzyme in the reaction. This intermediate complex allows the ATP to transfer its third phosphate group, with its energy, to the substrate, a process called phosphorylation.&nbsp;<strong>Phosphorylation</strong> refers to the addition of the phosphate (~P). This is illustrated by the following generic reaction:</p> <p style="text-align: center;">A + enzyme + ATP → [A − enzyme − ~P] → B + enzyme + ADP + phosphate ion</p> <p>When the intermediate complex breaks apart, the energy is used to modify the substrate and convert it into a product of the reaction. The ADP molecule and a free phosphate ion are released into the medium and are available for recycling through cell metabolism.</p> <h3>Substrate Phosphorylation</h3> <p>ATP is generated through two mechanisms during the breakdown of glucose. A few ATP molecules are generated (that is, regenerated from ADP) as a direct result of the chemical reactions that occur in the catabolic pathways. A phosphate group is removed from an intermediate reactant in the pathway, and the free energy of the reaction is used to add the third phosphate to an available ADP molecule, producing ATP (Figure 6). This very direct method of phosphorylation is called&nbsp;<strong>substrate-level phosphorylation</strong>.</p> <div id="attachment_1742" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1742" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03193108/Figure_07_01_03.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a substrate-level phosphorylation reaction in which the gamma phosphate of ATP is attached to a protein." width="544" height="150" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03193108/Figure_07_01_03.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03193108/Figure_07_01_03-300x83.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03193108/Figure_07_01_03-65x18.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03193108/Figure_07_01_03-225x62.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03193108/Figure_07_01_03-350x97.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 6.

Mitochondrial diseases are genetic disorders of metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders can arise from mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, and they result in the production of less energy than is normal in body cells. In type 2 diabetes, for instance, the oxidation efficiency of NADH is reduced, impacting oxidative phosphorylation but not the other steps of respiration. Symptoms of mitochondrial diseases can include muscle weakness, lack of coordination, stroke-like episodes, and loss of vision and hearing. Most affected people are diagnosed in childhood, although there are some adult-onset diseases. Identifying and treating mitochondrial disorders is a specialized medical field. The educational preparation for this profession requires a college education, followed by medical school with a specialization in medical genetics. Medical geneticists can be board certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics and go on to become associated with professional organizations devoted to the study of mitochondrial diseases, such as the Mitochondrial Medicine Society and the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disease.</p> </div> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>In Summary: ATP in Living Systems</h3> <p>ATP functions as the energy currency for cells. It allows the cell to store energy briefly and transport it within the cell to support endergonic chemical reactions. The structure of ATP is that of an RNA nucleotide with three phosphates attached. As ATP is used for energy, a phosphate group or two are detached, and either ADP or AMP is produced. Energy derived from glucose catabolism is used to convert ADP into ATP. When ATP is used in a reaction, the third phosphate is temporarily attached to a substrate in a process called phosphorylation. The two processes of ATP regeneration that are used in conjunction with glucose catabolism are substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation through the process of chemiosmosis.</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

Because they use light to manufacture their own food, they are called <strong>photoautotrophs </strong>(literally, “self-feeders using light”). Other organisms, such as animals, fungi, and most other bacteria, are termed <strong>heterotrophs</strong> (“other feeders”), because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs. A third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize sugars, not by using sunlight’s energy, but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds; hence, they are referred to as <strong>chemoautotrophs</strong>.</p> <p>The importance of photosynthesis is not just that it can capture sunlight’s energy. A lizard sunning itself on a cold day can use the sun’s energy to warm up. Photosynthesis is vital because it evolved as a way to store the energy in solar radiation (the “photo” part) as high-energy electrons in the carbon-carbon bonds of carbohydrate molecules (the “synthesis” part). Those carbohydrates are the energy source that heterotrophs use to power the synthesis of ATP via respiration. Therefore, photosynthesis powers 99 percent of Earth’s ecosystems. When a top predator, such as a wolf, preys on a deer (Figure 2), the wolf is at the end of an energy path that went from nuclear reactions on the surface of the sun, to light, to photosynthesis, to vegetation, to deer, and finally to wolf.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>Learning Objectives</h3> <ul><li>Identify the reactants and products of photosynthesis</li> <li>Describe the visible and electromagnetic spectrums of light as they applies to photosynthesis</li> <li>Describe the light-dependent reactions that take place during photosynthesis</li> <li>Identify the light-independent reactions in photosynthesis</li> </ul> </div> <p>Photosynthesis is a multi-step process that requires sunlight, carbon dioxide (which is low in energy), and water as substrates (Figure 3).

In addition, several enzymes of the light-independent reactions are activated by light. The light-dependent reactions utilize certain molecules to temporarily store the energy: These are referred to as energy carriers. The energy carriers that move energy from light-dependent reactions to light-independent reactions can be thought of as “full” because they are rich in energy. After the energy is released, the “empty” energy carriers return to the light-dependent reaction to obtain more energy. Figure 6&nbsp;illustrates the components inside the chloroplast where the light-dependent and light-independent reactions take place.</p> <div id="attachment_1770" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1770" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03202138/Figure_08_01_06.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a chloroplast with an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and stacks of membranes inside the inner membrane called thylakoids.

Foods that humans consume originate from photosynthesis. (credit: Associação Brasileira de Supermercados)</p> </div> <p>Major grocery stores in the United States are organized into departments, such as dairy, meats, produce, bread, cereals, and so forth. Each aisle (Figure 7) contains hundreds, if not thousands, of different products for customers to buy and consume.</p> <p>Although there is a large variety, each item links back to photosynthesis. Meats and dairy link because the animals were fed plant-based foods. The breads, cereals, and pastas come largely from starchy grains, which are the seeds of photosynthesis-dependent plants. What about desserts and drinks? All of these products contain sugar—sucrose is a plant product, a disaccharide, a carbohydrate molecule, which is built directly from photosynthesis. Moreover, many items are less obviously derived from plants: for instance, paper goods are generally plant products, and many plastics (abundant as products and packaging) can be&nbsp;derived from algae or from oil, the fossilized remains of photosynthetic organisms. Virtually every spice and flavoring in the spice aisle was produced by a plant as a leaf, root, bark, flower, fruit, or stem. Ultimately, photosynthesis connects to every meal and every food a person consumes.</p> </div> <h2>Spectrums of Light</h2> <p>How can light be used to make food? When a person turns on a lamp, electrical energy becomes light energy. Like all other forms of kinetic energy, light can travel, change form, and be harnessed to do work. In the case of photosynthesis, light energy is converted into chemical energy, which photoautotrophs use to build carbohydrate molecules. However, autotrophs only use a few specific components of sunlight.</p> <h3>What Is Light Energy?</h3> <p>The sun emits an enormous amount of electromagnetic radiation (solar energy). Humans can see only a fraction of this energy, which portion is therefore referred to as “visible light.” The manner in which solar energy travels is described as waves. Scientists can determine the amount of energy of a wave by measuring its wavelength, the distance between consecutive points of a wave. A single wave is measured from two consecutive points, such as from crest to crest or from trough to trough (Figure 8).</p> <div id="attachment_1775" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1775" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03202528/Figure_08_02_02.jpg" alt="The illustration shows two waves.

The sun emits energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. This radiation exists at different wavelengths, each of which has its own characteristic energy. All electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, is characterized by its wavelength.</p> </div> <p>Each type of electromagnetic radiation travels at a particular wavelength. The longer the wavelength (or the more stretched out it appears in the diagram), the less energy is carried. Short, tight waves carry the most energy. This may seem illogical, but think of it in terms of a piece of moving a heavy rope. It takes little effort by a person to move a rope in long, wide waves. To make a rope move in short, tight waves, a person would need to apply significantly more energy.</p> <p>The electromagnetic spectrum (Figure 9) shows several types of electromagnetic radiation originating from the sun, including X-rays and ultraviolet (UV) rays. The higher-energy waves can penetrate tissues and damage cells and DNA, explaining why both X-rays and UV rays can be harmful to living organisms.</p> <h3>Absorption of Light</h3> <p>Light energy initiates the process of photosynthesis when pigments absorb the light. Organic pigments, whether in the human retina or the chloroplast thylakoid, have a narrow range of energy levels that they can absorb. Energy levels lower than those represented by red light are insufficient to raise an orbital electron to a populatable, excited (quantum) state. Energy levels higher than those in blue light will physically tear the molecules apart, called bleaching. So retinal pigments can only “see” (absorb) 700 nm to 400 nm light, which is therefore called visible light. For the same reasons, plants pigment molecules absorb only light in the wavelength range of 700 nm to 400 nm; plant physiologists refer to this range for plants as photosynthetically active radiation.</p> <p>The visible light seen by humans as white light actually exists in a rainbow of colors. Certain objects, such as a prism or a drop of water, disperse white light to reveal the colors to the human eye. The visible light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum shows the rainbow of colors, with violet and blue having shorter wavelengths, and therefore higher energy. At the other end of the spectrum toward red, the wavelengths are longer and have lower energy (Figure 10).</p> <div id="attachment_1777" style="width: 1127px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1777" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03202714/Figure_08_02_04.jpg" alt="The illustration shows the colors of visible light.

Pigments reflect or transmit the wavelengths they cannot absorb, making them appear in the corresponding color.</p> <p>Chlorophylls and carotenoids are the two major classes of photosynthetic pigments found in plants and algae; each class has multiple types of pigment molecules. There are five major chlorophylls:&nbsp;<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> and <em>d</em> and a related molecule found in prokaryotes called bacteriochlorophyll. <strong>Chlorophyll </strong><em><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">a</strong></em> and <strong>chlorophyll </strong><em><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">b</strong></em> are found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be the focus of the following discussion.</p> <p>With dozens of different forms, carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments. The carotenoids found in fruit—such as the red of tomato (lycopene), the yellow of corn seeds (zeaxanthin), or the orange of an orange peel (β-carotene)—are used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers. In photosynthesis,<br /> <strong>carotenoids</strong> function as photosynthetic pigments that are very efficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy. When a leaf is exposed to full sun, the light-dependent reactions are required to process an enormous amount of energy; if that energy is not handled properly, it can do significant damage. Therefore, many carotenoids reside in the thylakoid membrane, absorb excess energy, and safely dissipate that energy as heat.</p> <p>Each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light, which is the&nbsp;<strong>absorption spectrum</strong>. The graph in&nbsp;Figure 11&nbsp;shows the absorption spectra for chlorophyll&nbsp;<em>a</em>, chlorophyll <em>b</em>, and a type of carotenoid pigment called β-carotene (which absorbs blue and green light). Notice how each pigment has a distinct set of peaks and troughs, revealing a highly specific pattern of absorption. Chlorophyll <em>a</em> absorbs wavelengths from either end of the visible spectrum (blue and red), but not green. Because green is reflected or transmitted, chlorophyll appears green. Carotenoids absorb in the short-wavelength blue region, and reflect the longer yellow, red, and orange wavelengths.</p> <div id="attachment_1778" style="width: 1127px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1778" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03202812/Figure_08_02_05abcd.jpg" alt="Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are made up of a long hydrocarbon chain attached to a large, complex ring made up of nitrogen and carbon.

Not all photosynthetic organisms have full access to sunlight. Some organisms grow underwater where light intensity and quality decrease and change with depth. Other organisms grow in competition for light. Plants on the rainforest floor must be able to absorb any bit of light that comes through, because the taller trees absorb most of the sunlight and scatter the remaining solar radiation (Figure 12).</p> <p>When studying a photosynthetic organism, scientists can determine the types of pigments present by generating absorption spectra.

In short, the light energy has now been captured by biological molecules but is not stored in any useful form yet. The energy is transferred from chlorophyll to chlorophyll until eventually (after about a millionth of a second), it is delivered to the reaction center. Up to this point, only energy has been transferred between molecules, not electrons.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <div id="attachment_1781" style="width: 1052px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1781" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03203046/Figure_08_02_08.jpg" alt="This illustration shows the components involved in the light reactions, which are all embedded in the thylakoid membrane.

The photosystem II (PSII) reaction center&nbsp;and the&nbsp;photosystem I (PSI).</p> </div> <p>In the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center, energy from sunlight is used to extract electrons from water. The electrons travel through the chloroplast electron transport chain to photosystem I (PSI), which reduces NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH. The electron transport chain moves protons across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. At the same time, splitting of water adds protons to the lumen, and reduction of NADPH removes protons from the stroma. The net result is a low pH in the thylakoid lumen, and a high pH in the stroma. ATP synthase uses this electrochemical gradient to make ATP. What is the initial source of electrons for the chloroplast electron transport chain?</p> <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>water</li> <li>oxygen</li> <li>carbon dioxide</li> <li>NADPH</li> </ol> <div class="qa-wrapper" style="display: block"><span class="show-answer collapsed" style="cursor: pointer" data-target="q829552">Show Answer</span> <div id="q829552" class="hidden-answer" style="display: none">Water is the initial source.</div> </div> </div> <p>The reaction center contains a pair of chlorophyll&nbsp;<em>a</em> molecules with a special property. Those two chlorophylls can undergo oxidation upon excitation; they can actually give up an electron in a process called a <strong>photoact</strong>. It is at this step in the reaction center, that light energy is converted into an excited electron. All of the subsequent steps involve getting that electron onto the energy carrier NADPH for delivery to the Calvin cycle where the electron is deposited onto carbon for long-term storage in the form of a carbohydrate. PSII and PSI are two major components of the photosynthetic <strong>electron transport chain</strong>, which also includes the <strong>cytochrome complex</strong>. The cytochrome complex, an enzyme composed of two protein complexes, transfers the electrons from the carrier molecule plastoquinone (Pq) to the protein plastocyanin (Pc), thus enabling both the transfer of protons across the thylakoid membrane and the transfer of electrons from PSII to PSI.</p> <p>The reaction center of PSII (called&nbsp;<strong>P680</strong>) delivers its high-energy electrons, one at the time, to the <strong>primary electron acceptor</strong>, and through the electron transport chain (Pq to cytochrome complex to plastocyanine) to PSI. P680’s missing electron is replaced by extracting a low-energy electron from water; thus, water is split and PSII is re-reduced after every photoact. Splitting one H<sub>2</sub>O molecule releases two electrons, two hydrogen atoms, and one atom of oxygen. Splitting two molecules is required to form one molecule of diatomic O<sub>2</sub> gas. About 10 percent of the oxygen is used by mitochondria in the leaf to support oxidative phosphorylation. The remainder escapes to the atmosphere where it is used by aerobic organisms to support respiration.</p> <p>As electrons move through the proteins that reside between PSII and PSI, they lose energy. That energy is used to move hydrogen atoms from the stromal side of the membrane to the thylakoid lumen. Those hydrogen atoms, plus the ones produced by splitting water, accumulate in the thylakoid lumen and will be used synthesize ATP in a later step. Because the electrons have lost energy prior to their arrival at PSI, they must be re-energized by PSI, hence, another photon is absorbed by the PSI antenna. That energy is relayed to the PSI reaction center (called&nbsp;<strong>P700</strong>). P700 is oxidized and sends a high-energy electron to NADP<sup>+</sup> to form NADPH. Thus, PSII captures the energy to create proton gradients to make ATP, and PSI captures the energy to reduce NADP<sup>+</sup> into NADPH. The two photosystems work in concert, in part, to guarantee that the production of NADPH will roughly equal the production of ATP. Other mechanisms exist to fine tune that ratio to exactly match the chloroplast’s constantly changing energy needs.</p> <h3>Generating an Energy Carrier: ATP</h3> <p>As in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria during cellular respiration, the buildup of hydrogen ions inside the thylakoid lumen creates a concentration gradient. The passive diffusion of hydrogen ions from high concentration (in the thylakoid lumen) to low concentration (in the stroma) is harnessed to create ATP, just as in the electron transport chain of cellular respiration. The ions build up energy because of diffusion and because they all have the same electrical charge, repelling each other.</p> <p>To release this energy, hydrogen ions will rush through any opening, similar to water jetting through a hole in a dam. In the thylakoid, that opening is a passage through a specialized protein channel called the ATP synthase. The energy released by the hydrogen ion stream allows ATP synthase to attach a third phosphate group to ADP, which forms a molecule of ATP (Figure 14). The flow of hydrogen ions through ATP synthase is called chemiosmosis because the ions move from an area of high to an area of low concentration through a semi-permeable structure.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">Visit this&nbsp;site and click through the <a href="http://dendro.cnre.vt.edu/forestbiology/photosynthesis.swf" target="_blank">animation to view the process of photosynthesis within a leaf</a>.</div> <h2>Light-Independent Reactions</h2> <p>After the energy from the sun is converted into chemical energy and temporarily stored in ATP and NADPH molecules, the cell has the fuel needed to build carbohydrate molecules for long-term energy storage. The products of the light-dependent reactions, ATP and NADPH, have lifespans in the range of millionths of seconds, whereas the products of the light-independent reactions (carbohydrates and other forms of reduced carbon) can survive for hundreds of millions of years. The carbohydrate molecules made will have a backbone of carbon atoms. Where does the carbon come from? It comes from carbon dioxide, the gas that is a waste product of respiration in microbes, fungi, plants, and animals.</p> <p>In plants, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) enters the leaves through stomata, where it diffuses over short distances through intercellular spaces until it reaches the mesophyll cells. Once in the mesophyll cells, CO<sub>2</sub> diffuses into the stroma of the chloroplast—the site of light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. These reactions actually have several names associated with them. Another term, the <strong>Calvin cycle</strong>, is named for the man who discovered it, and because these reactions function as a cycle. Others call it the Calvin-Benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery. The most outdated name is dark reactions, because light is not directly required (Figure 15). However, the term dark reaction can be misleading because it implies incorrectly that the reaction only occurs at night or is independent of light, which is why most scientists and instructors no longer use it.</p> <div id="attachment_1783" style="width: 1127px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1783" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03203318/Figure_08_03_01f.jpg" alt="This illustration shows that ATP and NADPH produced in the light reactions are used in the Calvin cycle to make sugar." width="1117" height="598" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03203318/Figure_08_03_01f.jpg 1117w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03203318/Figure_08_03_01f-300x161.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03203318/Figure_08_03_01f-768x411.jpg 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03203318/Figure_08_03_01f-1024x548.jpg 1024w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03203318/Figure_08_03_01f-65x35.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03203318/Figure_08_03_01f-225x120.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03203318/Figure_08_03_01f-350x187.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 15.

For each CO<sub>2</sub> molecule that reacts with one RuBP, two molecules of another compound (3-PGA) form. PGA has three carbons and one phosphate. Each turn of the cycle involves only one RuBP and one carbon dioxide and forms two molecules of 3-PGA. The number of carbon atoms remains the same, as the atoms move to form new bonds during the reactions (3 atoms from 3CO<sub>2</sub> + 15 atoms from 3RuBP = 18 atoms in 3 atoms of 3-PGA). This process is called&nbsp;<strong>carbon fixation</strong>, because CO<sub>2</sub> is “fixed” from an inorganic form into organic molecules.</p> <h3>Stage 2: Reduction</h3> <p>ATP and NADPH are used to convert the six molecules of 3-PGA into six molecules of a chemical called glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). That is a reduction reaction because it involves the gain of electrons by 3-PGA. Recall that a&nbsp;<strong>reduction</strong> is the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule. Six molecules of both ATP and NADPH are used. For ATP, energy is released with the loss of the terminal phosphate atom, converting it into ADP; for NADPH, both energy and a hydrogen atom are lost, converting it into NADP<sup>+</sup>. Both of these molecules return to the nearby light-dependent reactions to be reused and reenergized.</p> <h3>Stage 3: Regeneration</h3> <p>Interestingly, at this point, only one of the G3P molecules leaves the Calvin cycle and is sent to the cytoplasm to contribute to the formation of other compounds needed by the plant. Because the G3P exported from the chloroplast has three carbon atoms, it takes three “turns” of the Calvin cycle to fix enough net carbon to export one G3P. But each turn makes two G3Ps, thus three turns make six G3Ps. One is exported while the remaining five G3P molecules remain in the cycle and are used to regenerate RuBP, which enables the system to prepare for more CO<sub>2</sub> to be fixed. Three more molecules of ATP are used in these regeneration reactions.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><a href="http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/Bio231/calvin.html" target="_blank">This&nbsp;link leads to an animation of the Calvin cycle.</a> Click stage 1, stage 2, and then stage 3 to see G3P and ATP regenerate to form RuBP.</div> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>Evolution of Photosynthesis</h3> <div id="attachment_1786" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1786" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03203530/Figure_08_03_03.jpg" alt="This photo shows short, round prickly cacti growing in cracks in a rock." width="300" height="394" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03203530/Figure_08_03_03.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03203530/Figure_08_03_03-229x300.jpg 229w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03203530/Figure_08_03_03-65x85.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03203530/Figure_08_03_03-225x295.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03203530/Figure_08_03_03-350x459.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 17. The harsh conditions of the desert have led plants like these cacti to evolve variations of the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. These variations increase the efficiency of water usage, helping to conserve water and energy. (credit: Piotr Wojtkowski)</p> </div> <p>During the evolution of photosynthesis, a major shift occurred from the bacterial type of photosynthesis that involves only one photosystem and is typically anoxygenic (does not generate oxygen) into modern oxygenic (does generate oxygen) photosynthesis, employing two photosystems. This modern oxygenic photosynthesis is used by many organisms—from giant tropical leaves in the rainforest to tiny cyanobacterial cells—and the process and components of this photosynthesis remain largely the same. Photosystems absorb light and use electron transport chains to convert energy into the chemical energy of ATP and NADH. The subsequent light-independent reactions then assemble carbohydrate molecules with this energy.</p> <p>Photosynthesis in desert plants has evolved adaptations that conserve water. In the harsh dry heat, every drop of water must be used to survive. Because stomata must open to allow for the uptake of CO<sub>2</sub>, water escapes from the leaf during active photosynthesis. Desert plants have evolved processes to conserve water and deal with harsh conditions. A more efficient use of CO<sub>2</sub> allows plants to adapt to living with less water. Some plants such as cacti (Figure 17) can prepare materials for photosynthesis during the night by a temporary carbon fixation/storage process, because opening the stomata at this time conserves water due to cooler temperatures. In addition, cacti have evolved the ability to carry out low levels of photosynthesis without opening stomata at all, a mechanism to face extremely dry periods.</p> </div> <p>Now that we’ve learned about the different pieces of photosynthesis, let’s put it all together.

By harnessing energy from the sun, photosynthesis evolved to allow living things access to enormous amounts of energy. Because of photosynthesis, living things gained access to sufficient energy that allowed them to build new structures and achieve the biodiversity evident today.</p> <p>Only certain organisms, called photoautotrophs, can perform photosynthesis; they require the presence of chlorophyll, a specialized pigment that absorbs certain portions of the visible spectrum and can capture energy from sunlight. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to assemble carbohydrate molecules and release oxygen as a waste product into the atmosphere. Eukaryotic autotrophs, such as plants and algae, have organelles called chloroplasts in which photosynthesis takes place, and starch accumulates. In prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria, the process is less localized and occurs within folded membranes, extensions of the plasma membrane, and in the cytoplasm.</p> <p>The pigments of the first part of photosynthesis, the light-dependent reactions, absorb energy from sunlight. A photon strikes the antenna pigments of photosystem II to initiate photosynthesis. The energy travels to the reaction center that contains chlorophyll&nbsp;<em>a</em> to the electron transport chain, which pumps hydrogen ions into the thylakoid interior. This action builds up a high concentration of ions. The ions flow through ATP synthase via chemiosmosis to form molecules of ATP, which are used for the formation of sugar molecules in the second stage of photosynthesis. Photosystem I absorbs a second photon, which results in the formation of an NADPH molecule, another energy and reducing power carrier for the light-independent reactions.</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

The first half of glycolysis uses two ATP molecules in the phosphorylation of glucose, which is then split into two three-carbon molecules.</p> </div> <p>Step 1. The first step in glycolysis is catalyzed by hexokinase, an enzyme with broad specificity that catalyzes the phosphorylation of six-carbon sugars. Hexokinase phosphorylates glucose using ATP as the source of the phosphate, producing glucose-6-phosphate, a more reactive form of glucose. This reaction prevents the phosphorylated glucose molecule from continuing to interact with the GLUT proteins, and it can no longer leave the cell because the negatively charged phosphate will not allow it to cross the hydrophobic interior of the plasma membrane.</p> <p>Step 2. In the second step of glycolysis, an isomerase converts glucose-6-phosphate into one of its isomers, fructose-6-phosphate. An&nbsp;<strong>isomerase</strong> is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of a molecule into one of its isomers. This change from phosphoglucose to phosphofructose allows the eventual split of the sugar into two three-carbon molecules.</p> <p>Step 3. The third step is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase. A second ATP molecule donates a high-energy phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, producing fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. In this pathway, phosphofructokinase is a rate-limiting enzyme. It is active when the concentration of ADP is high; it is less active when ADP levels are low and the concentration of ATP is high. Thus, if there is “sufficient” ATP in the system, the pathway slows down. This is a type of end product inhibition, since ATP is the end product of glucose catabolism.</p> <p>Step 4. The newly added high-energy phosphates further destabilize fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The fourth step in glycolysis employs an enzyme, aldolase, to cleave 1,6-bisphosphate into two three-carbon isomers: dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.</p> <p>Step 5. In the fifth step, an isomerase transforms the dihydroxyacetone-phosphate into its isomer, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Thus, the pathway will continue with two molecules of a single isomer.

The second half of glycolysis involves phosphorylation without ATP investment (step 6) and produces two NADH and four ATP molecules per glucose.</p> </div> <p>Step 6. The sixth step in glycolysis (Figure 3) oxidizes the sugar (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate), extracting high-energy electrons, which are picked up by the electron carrier NAD<sup>+</sup>, producing NADH. The sugar is then phosphorylated by the addition of a second phosphate group, producing 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Note that the second phosphate group does not require another ATP molecule.</p> <p>Here again is a potential limiting factor for this pathway. The continuation of the reaction depends upon the availability of the oxidized form of the electron carrier, NAD<sup>+</sup>. Thus, NADH must be continuously oxidized back into NAD<sup>+</sup> in order to keep this step going. If NAD<sup>+</sup> is not available, the second half of glycolysis slows down or stops. If oxygen is available in the system, the NADH will be oxidized readily, though indirectly, and the high-energy electrons from the hydrogen released in this process will be used to produce ATP. In an environment without oxygen, an alternate pathway (fermentation) can provide the oxidation of NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup>.</p> <p>Step 7. In the seventh step, catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase (an enzyme named for the reverse reaction), 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate donates a high-energy phosphate to ADP, forming one molecule of ATP.

In the eighth step, the remaining phosphate group in 3-phosphoglycerate moves from the third carbon to the second carbon, producing 2-phosphoglycerate (an isomer of 3-phosphoglycerate). The enzyme catalyzing this step is a mutase (a type of isomerase).</p> <p>Step 9. Enolase catalyzes the ninth step. This enzyme causes 2-phosphoglycerate to lose water from its structure; this is a dehydration reaction, resulting in the formation of a double bond that increases the potential energy in the remaining phosphate bond and produces phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).</p> <p>Step 10. The last step in glycolysis is catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate kinase (the enzyme in this case is named for the reverse reaction of pyruvate’s conversion into PEP) and results in the production of a second ATP molecule by substrate-level phosphorylation and the compound pyruvic acid (or its salt form, pyruvate). Many enzymes in enzymatic pathways are named for the reverse reactions, since the enzyme can catalyze both forward and reverse reactions.</p> <h3>Outcomes of Glycolysis</h3> <p>Glycolysis starts with glucose and ends with two pyruvate molecules, a total of four ATP molecules and two molecules of NADH. Two ATP molecules were used in the first half of the pathway to prepare the six-carbon ring for cleavage, so the cell has a net gain of two&nbsp;ATP molecules and two NADH molecules for its use.</p> <p>If the cell cannot catabolize the pyruvate molecules further, it will harvest only two ATP molecules from one molecule of glucose. Mature mammalian red blood cells are not capable of&nbsp;<strong>aerobic respiration</strong>—the process in which organisms convert energy in the presence of oxygen—and glycolysis is their sole source of ATP. If glycolysis is interrupted, these cells lose their ability to maintain their sodium-potassium pumps, and eventually, they die.</p> <p>The last step in glycolysis will not occur if pyruvate kinase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of pyruvate, is not available in sufficient quantities. In this situation, the entire glycolysis pathway will proceed, but only two ATP molecules will be made in the second half. Thus, pyruvate kinase is a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>In Summary: Glycolysis</h3> <p>Glycolysis is the first pathway used in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy. It was probably one of the earliest metabolic pathways to evolve and is used by nearly all of the organisms on earth. Glycolysis consists of two parts: The first part prepares the six-carbon ring of glucose for cleavage into two three-carbon sugars. ATP is invested in the process during this half to energize the separation. The second half of glycolysis extracts ATP and high-energy electrons from hydrogen atoms and attaches them to NAD<sup>+</sup>. Two ATP molecules are invested in the first half and four ATP molecules are formed by substrate phosphorylation during the second half. This produces a net gain of two ATP and two NADH molecules for the cell.</p> <p>Figure 4&nbsp;shows the entire process of glycolysis in one image:</p> <div id="attachment_2285" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-2285" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/20211840/Glycolysis_metabolic_pathway.png" alt="The metabolic pathway of glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate by via a series of intermediate metabolites.

Unlike glycolysis, the citric acid cycle is a closed loop: The last part of the pathway regenerates the compound used in the first step. The eight steps of the cycle are a series of redox, dehydration, hydration, and decarboxylation reactions that produce two carbon dioxide molecules, one GTP/ATP, and reduced forms of NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> (Figure 6). This is considered an aerobic pathway because the NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> produced must transfer their electrons to the next pathway in the system, which will use oxygen.

Then, the first step of the cycle begins: This is a condensation step, combining the two-carbon acetyl group with a four-carbon oxaloacetate molecule to form a six-carbon molecule of <strong>citrate</strong>. CoA is bound to a sulfhydryl group (-SH) and diffuses away to eventually combine with another acetyl group. This step is irreversible because it is highly exergonic. The rate of this reaction is controlled by negative feedback and the amount of ATP available. If ATP levels increase, the rate of this reaction decreases. If ATP is in short supply, the rate increases.</p> <p>Step 2. In step two, citrate loses one water molecule and gains another as citrate is converted into its isomer, <strong>isocitrate</strong>.</p> <p>Step 3. In step three, isocitrate is oxidized, producing a five-carbon molecule, <strong>α-ketoglutarate</strong>, together with a molecule of CO<sub>2</sub> and two electrons, which reduce NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH. This step is also regulated by negative feedback from ATP and NADH, and a positive effect of ADP.</p> <p>Steps 3 and 4. Steps three and four are both oxidation and decarboxylation steps, which release electrons that reduce NAD<sup>+ </sup>to NADH and release carboxyl groups that form CO<sub>2</sub> molecules. α-Ketoglutarate is the product of step three, and a <strong>succinyl</strong> group is the product of step four. CoA binds the succinyl group to form succinyl CoA. The enzyme that catalyzes step four is regulated by feedback inhibition of ATP, succinyl CoA, and NADH.</p> <p>Step 5. In step five, a phosphate group is substituted for coenzyme A, and a high-energy bond is formed. This energy is used in substrate-level phosphorylation (during the conversion of the succinyl group to succinate) to form either guanine triphosphate (GTP) or ATP. There are two forms of the enzyme, called isoenzymes, for this step, depending upon the type of animal tissue in which they are found. One form is found in tissues that use large amounts of ATP, such as heart and skeletal muscle. This form produces ATP. The second form of the enzyme is found in tissues that have a high number of anabolic pathways, such as liver. This form produces GTP. GTP is energetically equivalent to ATP; however, its use is more restricted. In particular, protein synthesis primarily uses GTP.</p> <p>Step 6. Step six is a dehydration process that converts <strong>succinate</strong> into <strong>fumarate</strong>. Two hydrogen atoms are transferred to FAD, producing FADH<sub>2</sub>. The energy contained in the electrons of these atoms is insufficient to reduce NAD<sup>+</sup> but adequate to reduce FAD. Unlike NADH, this carrier remains attached to the enzyme and transfers the electrons to the electron transport chain directly. This process is made possible by the localization of the enzyme catalyzing this step inside the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.</p> <p>Step 7. Water is added to fumarate during step seven, and <strong>malate</strong> is produced. The last step in the citric acid cycle regenerates <strong>oxaloacetate</strong> by oxidizing malate. Another molecule of NADH is produced in the process.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><a href="http://www.johnkyrk.com/krebs.html" target="_blank">You can click through each step of the citric acid cycle here.</a></div> <h3>Products of the Citric Acid Cycle</h3> <p>Two carbon atoms come into the citric acid cycle from each acetyl group, representing four out of the six carbons of one glucose molecule. Two carbon dioxide molecules are released on each turn of the cycle; however, these do not necessarily contain the most recently added carbon atoms. The two acetyl carbon atoms will eventually be released on later turns of the cycle; thus, all six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are eventually incorporated into carbon dioxide. Each turn of the cycle forms three NADH molecules and one FADH<sub>2</sub> molecule. These carriers will connect with the last portion of aerobic respiration to produce ATP molecules. One GTP or ATP is also made in each cycle. Several of the intermediate compounds in the citric acid cycle can be used in synthesizing non-essential amino acids; therefore, the cycle is amphibolic (both catabolic and anabolic).</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>In Summary: Citric Acid Cycle</h3> <p>The citric acid cycle is a series of redox and decarboxylation reactions that remove high-energy electrons and carbon dioxide. The electrons temporarily stored in molecules of NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are used to generate ATP in a subsequent pathway. One molecule of either GTP or ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation on each turn of the cycle. There is no comparison of the cyclic pathway with a linear one.</p> </div> <h2>Electron Transport Chain</h2> <p>You have just read about two pathways in cellular respiration—glycolysis and the citric acid cycle—that generate ATP. However, most of the ATP generated during the aerobic catabolism of glucose is not generated directly from these pathways. Rather, it is derived from a process that begins with moving electrons through a series of electron transporters that undergo redox reactions: <strong>the electron transport chain</strong>. This causes hydrogen ions to accumulate within the matrix space. Therefore, a concentration gradient forms in which hydrogen ions diffuse out of the matrix space by passing through ATP synthase. The current of hydrogen ions powers the catalytic action of ATP synthase, which phosphorylates ADP, producing ATP.</p> <h3>Electron Transport Chain</h3> <div id="attachment_1754" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1754" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03200406/Figure_07_04_01.jpg" alt="This illustration shows the electron transport chain embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

The electron transport chain is a series of electron transporters embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane that shuttles electrons from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> to molecular oxygen. In the process, protons are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, and oxygen is reduced to form water.</p> </div> <p>The electron transport chain (Figure 7) is the last component of aerobic respiration and is the only part of glucose metabolism that uses atmospheric oxygen. Oxygen continuously diffuses into plants; in animals, it enters the body through the respiratory system. Electron transport is a series of redox reactions that resemble a relay race or bucket brigade in that electrons are passed rapidly from one component to the next, to the endpoint of the chain where the electrons reduce molecular oxygen, producing water. There are four complexes composed of proteins, labeled I through IV in Figure 7, and the aggregation of these four complexes, together with associated mobile, accessory electron carriers, is called the electron transport chain. The electron transport chain is present in multiple copies in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes and the plasma membrane of prokaryotes.&nbsp;Note, however, that the electron transport chain of prokaryotes may not require oxygen as some live in anaerobic conditions. The common feature of all electron transport chains is the presence of a proton pump to create a proton gradient across a membrane.</p> <h4>Complex I</h4> <p>To start, two electrons are carried to the first complex aboard NADH. This complex, labeled I, is composed of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and an iron-sulfur (Fe-S)-containing protein. FMN, which is derived from vitamin B<sub>2</sub>, also called riboflavin, is one of several prosthetic groups or co-factors in the electron transport chain. A&nbsp;<strong>prosthetic group</strong> is a non-protein molecule required for the activity of a protein. Prosthetic groups are organic or inorganic, non-peptide molecules bound to a protein that facilitate its function; prosthetic groups include co-enzymes, which are the prosthetic groups of enzymes. The enzyme in complex I is NADH dehydrogenase and is a very large protein, containing 45 amino acid chains. Complex I can pump four hydrogen ions across the membrane from the matrix into the intermembrane space, and it is in this way that the hydrogen ion gradient is established and maintained between the two compartments separated by the inner mitochondrial membrane.</p> <h4>Q and Complex II</h4> <p>Complex II directly receives FADH<sub>2</sub>, which does not pass through complex I. The compound connecting the first and second complexes to the third is&nbsp;<strong>ubiquinone</strong> (Q). The Q molecule is lipid soluble and freely moves through the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Once it is reduced, (QH<sub>2</sub>), ubiquinone delivers its electrons to the next complex in the electron transport chain. Q receives the electrons derived from NADH from complex I and the electrons derived from FADH<sub>2</sub> from complex II, including succinate dehydrogenase. This enzyme and FADH<sub>2</sub> form a small complex that delivers electrons directly to the electron transport chain, bypassing the first complex. Since these electrons bypass and thus do not energize the proton pump in the first complex, fewer ATP molecules are made from the FADH<sub>2</sub> electrons. The number of ATP molecules ultimately obtained is directly proportional to the number of protons pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane.</p> <h4>Complex III</h4> <p>The third complex is composed of cytochrome b, another Fe-S protein, Rieske center (2Fe-2S center), and cytochrome c proteins; this complex is also called cytochrome oxidoreductase. Cytochrome proteins have a prosthetic group of heme. The heme molecule is similar to the heme in hemoglobin, but it carries electrons, not oxygen. As a result, the iron ion at its core is reduced and oxidized as it passes the electrons, fluctuating between different oxidation states: Fe<sup>+</sup><sup>+</sup> (reduced) and Fe<sup>+</sup><sup>+</sup><sup>+</sup> (oxidized). The heme molecules in the cytochromes have slightly different characteristics due to the effects of the different proteins binding them, giving slightly different characteristics to each complex. Complex III pumps protons through the membrane and passes its electrons to cytochrome c for transport to the fourth complex of proteins and enzymes (cytochrome c is the acceptor of electrons from Q; however, whereas Q carries pairs of electrons, cytochrome c can accept only one at a time).</p> <h4>Complex IV</h4> <p>The fourth complex is composed of cytochrome proteins c, a, and a<sub>3</sub>. This complex contains two heme groups (one in each of the two cytochromes, a, and a<sub>3</sub>) and three copper ions (a pair of Cu<sub>A</sub> and one Cu<sub>B</sub> in cytochrome a<sub>3</sub>). The cytochromes hold an oxygen molecule very tightly between the iron and copper ions until the oxygen is completely reduced. The reduced oxygen then picks up two hydrogen ions from the surrounding medium to make water (H<sub>2</sub>O). The removal of the hydrogen ions from the system contributes to the ion gradient used in the process of chemiosmosis.</p> <h3>Chemiosmosis</h3> <p>In chemiosmosis, the free energy from the series of redox reactions just described is used to pump hydrogen ions (protons) across the membrane. The uneven distribution of H<sup>+</sup> ions across the membrane establishes both concentration and electrical gradients (thus, an electrochemical gradient), owing to the hydrogen ions’ positive charge and their aggregation on one side of the membrane.</p> <p>If the membrane were open to diffusion by the hydrogen ions, the ions would tend to diffuse back across into the matrix, driven by their electrochemical gradient. Recall that many ions cannot diffuse through the nonpolar regions of phospholipid membranes without the aid of ion channels. Similarly, hydrogen ions in the matrix space can only pass through the inner mitochondrial membrane through an integral membrane protein called ATP synthase (Figure 8). This complex protein acts as a tiny generator, turned by the force of the hydrogen ions diffusing through it, down their electrochemical gradient. The turning of parts of this molecular machine facilitates the addition of a phosphate to ADP, forming ATP, using the potential energy of the hydrogen ion gradient.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <div id="attachment_1755" style="width: 479px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1755" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03200520/Figure_07_04_02.png" alt="This illustration shows an ATP synthase enzyme embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

<div id="q346232" class="hidden-answer" style="display: none">After DNP poisoning, the electron transport chain can no longer form a proton gradient, and ATP synthase can no longer make ATP. DNP is an effective diet drug because it uncouples ATP synthesis; in other words, after taking it, a person obtains less energy out of the food he or she eats. Interestingly, one of the worst side effects of this drug is hyperthermia, or overheating of the body. Since ATP cannot be formed, the energy from electron transport is lost as heat.</div>

<p>Chemiosmosis (Figure 9) is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during aerobic glucose catabolism; it is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight in the process of photophosphorylation. Recall that the production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis in mitochondria is called oxidative phosphorylation. The overall result of these reactions is the production of ATP from the energy of the electrons removed from hydrogen atoms. These atoms were originally part of a glucose molecule. At the end of the pathway, the electrons are used to reduce an oxygen molecule to oxygen ions. The extra electrons on the oxygen attract hydrogen ions (protons) from the surrounding medium, and water is formed.</p>

The pH of the intermembrane space would increase, the pH gradient would decrease, and ATP synthesis would stop.</div> </div> </div> <h3>ATP Yield</h3> <p>The number of ATP molecules generated from the catabolism of glucose varies. For example, the number of hydrogen ions that the electron transport chain complexes can pump through the membrane varies between species. Another source of variance stems from the shuttle of electrons across the membranes of the mitochondria. (The NADH generated from glycolysis cannot easily enter mitochondria.) Thus, electrons are picked up on the inside of mitochondria by either NAD<sup>+</sup> or FAD<sup>+</sup>. As you have learned earlier, these FAD<sup>+</sup> molecules can transport fewer ions; consequently, fewer ATP molecules are generated when FAD<sup>+</sup> acts as a carrier. NAD<sup>+</sup> is used as the electron transporter in the liver and FAD<sup>+</sup> acts in the brain.</p> <p>Another factor that affects the yield of ATP molecules generated from glucose is the fact that intermediate compounds in these pathways are used for other purposes. Glucose catabolism connects with the pathways that build or break down all other biochemical compounds in cells, and the result is somewhat messier than the ideal situations described thus far. For example, sugars other than glucose are fed into the glycolytic pathway for energy extraction. Moreover, the five-carbon sugars that form nucleic acids are made from intermediates in glycolysis. Certain nonessential amino acids can be made from intermediates of both glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, are also made from intermediates in these pathways, and both amino acids and triglycerides are broken down for energy through these pathways. Overall, in living systems, these pathways of glucose catabolism extract about 34 percent of the energy contained in glucose.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>In Summary: Electron Transport Chain</h3> <p>The electron transport chain is the portion of aerobic respiration that uses free oxygen as the final electron acceptor of the electrons removed from the intermediate compounds in glucose catabolism. The electron transport chain is composed of four large, multiprotein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and two small diffusible electron carriers shuttling electrons between them. The electrons are passed through a series of redox reactions, with a small amount of free energy used at three points to transport hydrogen ions across a membrane. This process contributes to the gradient used in chemiosmosis. The electrons passing through the electron transport chain gradually lose energy, High-energy electrons donated to the chain by either NADH or FADH<sub>2</sub> complete the chain, as low-energy electrons reduce oxygen molecules and form water. The level of free energy of the electrons drops from about 60 kcal/mol in NADH or 45 kcal/mol in FADH<sub>2</sub> to about 0 kcal/mol in water. The end products of the electron transport chain are water and ATP. A number of intermediate compounds of the citric acid cycle can be diverted into the anabolism of other biochemical molecules, such as nonessential amino acids, sugars, and lipids. These same molecules can serve as energy sources for the glucose pathways.</p> </div> <h2>Let’s Review</h2> <p>Cellular respiration is a collection of three unique metabolic pathways: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain.&nbsp;Glycolysis is an anaerobic process, while the other two pathways are&nbsp;aerobic. In order to move from glycolysis to the citric acid cycle, pyruvate molecules (the output of glycolysis) must be oxidized in a process called pyruvate oxidation.</p> <h3>Glycolysis</h3> <p>Glycolysis is the first pathway in cellular respiration. This pathway is anaerobic and takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell.&nbsp;This pathway&nbsp;breaks down 1 glucose molecule and produces 2 pyruvate molecules.&nbsp;There are two halves of glycolysis, with five steps in each half.&nbsp;The first half is known as the “energy requiring” steps. This half&nbsp;splits glucose, and uses up 2 ATP.&nbsp;If the concentration of pyruvate kinase is high enough, the second half of glycolysis can proceed.&nbsp;In the second half, the “energy releasing: steps, 4 molecules of ATP and 2 NADH are released.&nbsp;Glycolysis has a <strong>net gain&nbsp;</strong>of<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;2 ATP molecules and 2 NADH.</p> <p>Some cells (e.g., mature mammalian red blood cells) cannot undergo aerobic respiration, so glycolysis is their <strong>only</strong> source of ATP. However, most cells undergo pyruvate oxidation and continue&nbsp;to the other pathways of cellular respiration.</p> <h3>Pyruvate Oxidation</h3> <p>In eukaryotes, pyruvate oxidation&nbsp;takes place in the mitochondria. Pyruvate oxidation can only happen if oxygen is available. In this process, the&nbsp;pyruvate created by glycolysis is oxidized. In this oxidation process,&nbsp;a carboxyl group is removed from pyruvate, creating&nbsp;acetyl groups, which compound with coenzyme A (CoA) to form acetyl CoA.&nbsp;This process also releases CO<sub>2</sub>.</p> <h3>Citric Acid Cycle</h3> <p>The citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle) is the second pathway in cellular respiration, and it also takes place in the mitochondria. The rate of the cycle is controlled by ATP concentration. When there is more ATP available, the rate slows down; when there is less ATP the rate increases.&nbsp;This pathway is a closed loop: the final step produces the compound needed for the first step.</p> <p>The citric acid cycle is considered an aerobic pathway because the&nbsp;NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> it produces act as temporary electron storage compounds, transferring their electrons to the next pathway (electron transport chain), which uses atmospheric oxygen.&nbsp;Each turn of the citric acid cycle provides a <strong>net gain </strong>of&nbsp;CO<sub>2</sub>, 1 GTP or ATP, and&nbsp;3 NADH and 1&nbsp;FADH<sub>2</sub>.</p> <h3>Electron Transport Chain</h3> <p>Most ATP from&nbsp;glucose is generated in the electron transport chain. It&nbsp;is the only part of cellular respiration that directly consumes oxygen; however, in some&nbsp;prokaryotes, this is an anaerobic pathway.&nbsp;In eukaryotes, this pathway takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. In&nbsp;prokaryotes&nbsp;it occurs in the plasma membrane.</p> <p>The electron transport chain is made up of 4 proteins along the membrane and a proton pump. A&nbsp;cofactor shuttles electrons between proteins I–III. If NAD is depleted, skip I: FADH<sub>2</sub> starts on II.&nbsp;In chemiosmosis, a proton pump takes hydrogens from inside mitochondria to the outside; this spins the “motor” and the phosphate groups attach to that.&nbsp;The movement changes from ADP to ATP, creating 90% of ATP obtained from aerobic glucose catabolism.</p> <h2>Let’s Practice</h2> <p>Now that you’ve reviewed cellular respiration,&nbsp;this practice activity will help you see how well you know&nbsp;cellular respiration:</p> <p></p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

If aerobic respiration occurs, then ATP will be produced using the energy of high-energy electrons carried by NADH or FADH<sub>2</sub> to the electron transport chain. If aerobic respiration does not occur, NADH must be reoxidized to NAD<sup>+</sup> for reuse as an electron carrier for the glycolytic pathway to continue. How is this done? Some living systems use an organic molecule as the final electron acceptor. Processes that use an organic molecule to regenerate NAD<sup>+</sup> from NADH are collectively referred to as&nbsp;<strong>fermentation</strong>. In contrast, some living systems use an inorganic molecule as a final electron acceptor. Both methods are called <strong>anaerobic cellular respiration</strong> in which organisms convert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen.</p> <h3>Anaerobic Cellular Respiration</h3> <p>Certain prokaryotes, including some species of bacteria and Archaea, use anaerobic respiration. For example, the group of Archaea called methanogens reduces carbon dioxide to methane to oxidize NADH. These microorganisms are found in soil and in the digestive tracts of ruminants, such as cows and sheep. Similarly, sulfate-reducing bacteria and Archaea, most of which are anaerobic (Figure 1), reduce sulfate to hydrogen sulfide to regenerate NAD<sup>+</sup> from NADH.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><a href="https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/biomi290/z.OldWebSite/MOVIES/GLYCOLYSIS.HTML" target="_blank">Visit this&nbsp;site to see anaerobic cellular respiration in action.</a></div> <h2>Lactic Acid Fermentation</h2> <p>The fermentation method used by animals and certain bacteria, like those in yogurt, is <strong>lactic acid fermentation</strong> (Figure 2). This type of fermentation is used routinely in mammalian red blood cells and in skeletal muscle that has an insufficient oxygen supply to allow aerobic respiration to continue (that is, in muscles used to the point of fatigue). In muscles, lactic acid accumulation must be removed by the blood circulation and the lactate brought to the liver for further metabolism. The chemical reactions of lactic acid fermentation are the following:</p> <p style="text-align: center;">[latex]\text{Pyruvic acid}+\text{NADH}\longleftrightarrow\text{lactic acid}+\text{NAD}^+[/latex]</p> <p>The enzyme used in this reaction is lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The reaction can proceed in either direction, but the reaction from left to right is inhibited by acidic conditions. Such lactic acid accumulation was once believed to cause muscle stiffness, fatigue, and soreness, although more recent research disputes this hypothesis. Once the lactic acid has been removed from the muscle and circulated to the liver, it can be reconverted into pyruvic acid and further catabolized for energy.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <div id="attachment_1760" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1760 size-full" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03200955/Figure_07_05_02.png" alt="This illustration shows that during glycolysis, glucose is broken down into two pyruvate molecules and, in the process, two NADH are formed from NAD^{+}.

The second reaction is catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase to oxidize NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> and reduce acetaldehyde to ethanol. The fermentation of pyruvic acid by yeast produces the ethanol found in alcoholic beverages. Ethanol tolerance of yeast is variable, ranging from about 5 percent to 21 percent, depending on the yeast strain and environmental conditions.</p> <div id="attachment_2585" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-2585" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/03145335/1024px-Ethanol_fermentation-1.svg_-1024x688.png" alt="In alcohol fermentation.

Many prokaryotes are facultatively anaerobic. This means that they can switch between aerobic respiration and fermentation, depending on the availability of oxygen. Certain prokaryotes, like&nbsp;<em>Clostridia</em>, are obligate anaerobes. Obligate anaerobes live and grow in the absence of molecular oxygen. Oxygen is a poison to these microorganisms and kills them on exposure.</p> <p>It should be noted that all forms of fermentation, except lactic acid fermentation, produce gas. The production of particular types of gas is used as an indicator of the fermentation of specific carbohydrates, which plays a role in the laboratory identification of the bacteria. Various methods of fermentation are used by assorted organisms to ensure an adequate supply of NAD<sup>+</sup> for the sixth step in glycolysis. Without these pathways, that step would not occur and no ATP would be harvested from the breakdown of glucose.</p> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

Remember, living things need energy to perform life functions. In addition, an organism can either make its own food or eat another organism—either way, the food still needs to be converted to a form cells can actually use.

You would not be able to express your wishes to others, nor could you ask questions to find out more about your environment. Social organization is dependent on communication between the individuals that comprise that society; without communication, society would fall apart.</p> <p>As with people, it is vital for individual cells to be able to interact with their environment. This is true whether a cell is growing by itself in a pond or is one of many cells that form a larger organism. In order to properly respond to external stimuli, cells have developed complex mechanisms of communication that can receive a message, transfer the information across the plasma membrane, and then produce changes within the cell in response to the message.</p> <p>In multicellular organisms, cells send and receive chemical messages constantly to coordinate the actions of distant organs, tissues, and cells. The ability to send messages quickly and efficiently enables cells to coordinate and fine-tune their functions.</p> <p>While the necessity for cellular communication in larger organisms seems obvious, even single-celled organisms communicate with each other. Yeast cells signal each other to aid mating. Some forms of bacteria coordinate their actions in order to form large complexes called biofilms or to organize the production of toxins to remove competing organisms. The ability of cells to communicate through chemical signals originated in single cells and was essential for the evolution of multicellular organisms. The efficient and error-free function of communication systems is vital for all life as we know it.</p> <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3> <ul><li>Differentiate between different types of signals</li> <li>Describe how a cell propagates a signal</li> <li>Describe how a cell responds to a signal</li> <li>Discuss the process of signaling in single-celled organisms</li> </ul> </div><div class="licensing"><div class="license-attribution-dropdown-subheading">CC licensed content, Original</div><ul class="citation-list"><li><strong>Authored by</strong>: Shelli Carter and Lumen Learning. <strong>Provided by</strong>: Lumen Learning. <strong>License</strong>: <em><a target="_blank" rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY: Attribution</a></em></li></ul><div class="license-attribution-dropdown-subheading">CC licensed content, Shared previously</div><ul class="citation-list"><li>Biology. <strong>Provided by</strong>: OpenStax CNX. <strong>Located at</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="http://cnx.org/contents/185cbf87-c72e-48f5-b51e-f14f21b5eabd@10.8">http://cnx.org/contents/185cbf87-c72e-48f5-b51e-f14f21b5eabd@10.8</a>. <strong>License</strong>: <em><a target="_blank" rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY: Attribution</a></em>. <strong>License Terms</strong>: Download for free at http://cnx.org/contents/185cbf87-c72e-48f5-b51e-f14f21b5eabd@10.8</li><li>Communication. <strong>Authored by</strong>: Lorenzo Stella. <strong>Located at</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="https://thenounproject.com/term/communication/27324/">https://thenounproject.com/term/communication/27324/</a>. <strong>License</strong>: <em><a target="_blank" rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY: Attribution</a></em></li></ul></div>

Communication between cells is called <strong>intercellular signaling</strong>, and communication within a cell is called <strong>intracellular signaling</strong>. An easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes: <em>inter</em>– means “between” (for example, intersecting lines are those that cross each other) and <em>intra</em>– means “inside” (like intravenous).</p> <p>Chemical signals are released by <strong>signaling cells</strong> in the form of small, usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands. A <strong>ligand</strong> is a molecule that binds another specific molecule, in some cases, delivering a signal in the process. Ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules. Ligands interact with proteins in <strong>target cells</strong>, which are cells that are affected by chemical signals; these proteins are also called <strong>receptors</strong>. Ligands and receptors exist in several varieties; however, a specific ligand will have a specific receptor that typically binds only that ligand.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>Learning Objectives</h3> <ul><li>Differentiate between different types of signals used by multicellular organisms</li> <li>Identify different types of signaling molecules</li> <li>Identify types of receptors, their molecular composition, and the differences among them</li> </ul> </div> <h2>&nbsp;Types of Signals</h2> <p>There are four categories of chemical signaling found in multicellular organisms: paracrine signaling, endocrine signaling, autocrine signaling, and direct signaling across gap junctions (Figure&nbsp;1). The main difference between the different categories of signaling is the distance that the signal travels through the organism to reach the target cell. Not all cells are affected by the same signals.</p> <div id="attachment_1639" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1639" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02233129/Figure_09_01_01.jpg" alt="The illustration shows four forms of chemical signaling.

In chemical signaling, a cell may target itself (autocrine signaling), a cell connected by gap junctions, a nearby cell (paracrine signaling), or a distant cell (endocrine signaling). Paracrine signaling acts on nearby cells, endocrine signaling uses the circulatory system to transport ligands, and autocrine signaling acts on the signaling cell. Signaling via gap junctions involves signaling molecules moving directly between adjacent cells.</p> </div> <h3>Paracrine Signaling</h3> <div id="attachment_1640" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1640" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02233201/Figure_09_01_02.jpg" alt="This illustration shows closely juxtaposed bulbous protrusions of presynaptic and postsynaptic cells.

When signaling occurs, the vesicles fuse with the cell membrane, thereby releasing the neutrotransmitter, which then binds to receptors on the postsynaptic cell. An enzyme on the surface of the postsynaptic cell destroys the neurotrasmitter, thereby terminating the signal." width="400" height="506" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02233201/Figure_09_01_02.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02233201/Figure_09_01_02-237x300.jpg 237w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02233201/Figure_09_01_02-65x82.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02233201/Figure_09_01_02-225x285.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02233201/Figure_09_01_02-350x443.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure&nbsp;2. The distance between the presynaptic cell and the postsynaptic cell—called the synaptic gap—is very small and allows for rapid diffusion of the neurotransmitter. Enzymes in the synaptic cleft degrade some types of neurotransmitters to terminate the signal.</p> </div> <p>Signals that act locally between cells that are close together are called <strong>paracrine signals</strong>. Paracrine signals move by diffusion through the extracellular matrix. These types of signals usually elicit quick responses that last only a short amount of time. In order to keep the response localized, paracrine ligand molecules are normally quickly degraded by enzymes or removed by neighboring cells. Removing the signals will reestablish the concentration gradient for the signal, allowing them to quickly diffuse through the intracellular space if released again.</p> <p>One example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells. A nerve cell consists of a cell body, several short, branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli, and a long extension called an axon, which transmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells. The junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse. A&nbsp;<strong>synaptic signal</strong> is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells. Signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast-moving electrical impulses. When these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called <strong>neurotransmitters</strong> by the presynaptic cell (the cell emitting the signal). The neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells, which are called <strong>chemical synapses</strong> (Figure&nbsp;2). The small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly; this enables an immediate response, such as, Take your hand off the stove!</p> <p>When the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell, the electrochemical potential of the target cell changes, and the next electrical impulse is launched. The neurotransmitters that are released into the chemical synapse are degraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell so that the recipient nerve cell can recover quickly and be prepared to respond rapidly to the next synaptic signal.</p> <h3>Endocrine Signaling</h3> <p>Signals from distant cells are called&nbsp;<strong>endocrine signals</strong>, and they originate from <strong>endocrine cells</strong>. (In the body, many endocrine cells are located in endocrine glands, such as the thyroid gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary gland.) These types of signals usually produce a slower response but have a longer-lasting effect. The ligands released in endocrine signaling are called hormones, signaling molecules that are produced in one part of the body but affect other body regions some distance away.</p> <p>Hormones travel the large distances between endocrine cells and their target cells via the bloodstream, which is a relatively slow way to move throughout the body. Because of their form of transport, hormones get diluted and are present in low concentrations when they act on their target cells. This is different from paracrine signaling, in which local concentrations of ligands can be very high.</p> <h3>Autocrine Signaling</h3> <p><strong>Autocrine signals</strong> are produced by signaling cells that can also bind to the ligand that is released. This means the signaling cell and the target cell can be the same or a similar cell (the prefix&nbsp;<em>auto-</em> means self, a reminder that the signaling cell sends a signal to itself). This type of signaling often occurs during the early development of an organism to ensure that cells develop into the correct tissues and take on the proper function. Autocrine signaling also regulates pain sensation and inflammatory responses. Further, if a cell is infected with a virus, the cell can signal itself to undergo programmed cell death, killing the virus in the process. In some cases, neighboring cells of the same type are also influenced by the released ligand. In embryological development, this process of stimulating a group of neighboring cells may help to direct the differentiation of identical cells into the same cell type, thus ensuring the proper developmental outcome.</p> <h3>Direct Signaling Across Gap Junctions</h3> <p>Gap junctions in animals and plasmodesmata in plants are connections between the plasma membranes of neighboring cells. These water-filled channels allow small signaling molecules, called&nbsp;<strong>intracellular mediators</strong>, to diffuse between the two cells. Small molecules, such as calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), are able to move between cells, but large molecules like proteins and DNA cannot fit through the channels. The specificity of the channels ensures that the cells remain independent but can quickly and easily transmit signals. The transfer of signaling molecules communicates the current state of the cell that is directly next to the target cell; this allows a group of cells to coordinate their response to a signal that only one of them may have received. In plants, plasmodesmata are ubiquitous, making the entire plant into a giant, communication network.</p> <h2>Signaling Molecules</h2> <p>Produced by signaling cells and the subsequent binding to receptors in target cells, ligands act as chemical signals that travel to the target cells to coordinate responses. The types of molecules that serve as ligands are incredibly varied and range from small proteins to small ions like calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>).</p> <h3>Small Hydrophobic Ligands</h3> <div id="attachment_1647" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1647" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02234001/Figure_09_01_08.jpg" alt="The molecular structures of estradiol, testosterone, and cholesterol are shown.

Steroid hormones have similar chemical structures to their precursor, cholesterol. Because these molecules are small and hydrophobic, they can diffuse directly across the plasma membrane into the cell, where they interact with internal receptors.</p> </div> <p>Small hydrophobic ligands can directly diffuse through the plasma membrane and interact with internal receptors. Important members of this class of ligands are the steroid hormones. Steroids are lipids that have a hydrocarbon skeleton with four fused rings; different steroids have different functional groups attached to the carbon skeleton. Steroid hormones include the female sex hormone, estradiol, which is a type of estrogen; the male sex hormone, testosterone; and cholesterol, which is an important structural component of biological membranes and a precursor of steroid hormones (Figure 3). Other hydrophobic hormones include thyroid hormones and vitamin D. In order to be soluble in blood, hydrophobic ligands must bind to carrier proteins while they are being transported through the bloodstream.</p> <h3>Water-Soluble Ligands</h3> <p>Water-soluble ligands are polar and therefore cannot pass through the plasma membrane unaided; sometimes, they are too large to pass through the membrane at all. Instead, most water-soluble ligands bind to the extracellular domain of cell-surface receptors. This group of ligands is quite diverse and includes small molecules, peptides, and proteins.</p> <h3>Other Ligands</h3> <p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas that also acts as a ligand. It is able to diffuse directly across the plasma membrane, and one of its roles is to interact with receptors in smooth muscle and induce relaxation of the tissue. NO has a very short half-life and therefore only functions over short distances. Nitroglycerin, a treatment for heart disease, acts by triggering the release of NO, which causes blood vessels to dilate (expand), thus restoring blood flow to the heart. NO has become better known recently because the pathway that it affects is targeted by prescription medications for erectile dysfunction, such as Viagra (erection involves dilated blood vessels).</p> <h2>Signaling Receptors</h2> <p>Receptors are protein molecules in the target cell or on its surface that bind ligand. There are two types of receptors, internal receptors and cell-surface receptors.</p> <h3>Internal receptors</h3> <div id="attachment_1641" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1641" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02233303/Figure_09_01_03.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a hydrophobic signaling molecule that diffuses across the plasma membrane and binds an intracellular receptor in the cytoplasm.

Hydrophobic signaling molecules typically diffuse across the plasma membrane and interact with intracellular receptors in the cytoplasm. Many intracellular receptors are transcription factors that interact with DNA in the nucleus and regulate gene expression.</p> </div> <p><strong>Internal receptors</strong>, also known as intracellular or cytoplasmic receptors, are found in the cytoplasm of the cell and respond to hydrophobic ligand molecules that are able to travel across the plasma membrane. Once inside the cell, many of these molecules bind to proteins that act as regulators of mRNA synthesis (transcription) to mediate gene expression. Gene expression is the cellular process of transforming the information in a cell’s DNA into a sequence of amino acids, which ultimately forms a protein. When the ligand binds to the internal receptor, a conformational change is triggered that exposes a DNA-binding site on the protein. The ligand-receptor complex moves into the nucleus, then binds to specific regulatory regions of the chromosomal DNA and promotes the initiation of transcription (Figure 4). Transcription is the process of copying the information in a cell’s DNA into a special form of RNA called messenger RNA (mRNA); the cell uses information in the mRNA (which moves out into the cytoplasm and associates with ribosomes) to link specific amino acids in the correct order, producing a protein. Internal receptors can directly influence gene expression without having to pass the signal on to other receptors or messengers.</p> <h3>Cell-Surface Receptors</h3> <p><strong>Cell-surface receptors</strong>, also known as transmembrane receptors, are cell surface, membrane-anchored (integral) proteins that bind to external ligand molecules. This type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction, in which an extracellular signal is converted into an intercellular signal. Ligands that interact with cell-surface receptors do not have to enter the cell that they affect. Cell-surface receptors are also called cell-specific proteins or markers because they are specific to individual cell types.</p> <p>Each cell-surface receptor has three main components: an external ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic membrane-spanning region, and an intracellular domain inside the cell. The ligand-binding domain is also called the&nbsp;<strong>extracellular domain</strong>. The size and extent of each of these domains vary widely, depending on the type of receptor.</p> <p>Because cell-surface receptor proteins are fundamental to normal cell functioning, it should come as no surprise that a malfunction in any one of these proteins could have severe consequences. Errors in the protein structures of certain receptor molecules have been shown to play a role in hypertension (high blood pressure), asthma, heart disease, and cancer.</p> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>How Viruses Recognize a Host</h3> <p>Unlike living cells, many viruses do not have a plasma membrane or any of the structures necessary to sustain life. Some viruses are simply composed of an inert protein shell containing DNA or RNA. To reproduce, viruses must invade a living cell, which serves as a host, and then take over the host’s cellular apparatus. But how does a virus recognize its host?</p> <p>Viruses often bind to cell-surface receptors on the host cell. For example, the virus that causes human influenza (flu) binds specifically to receptors on membranes of cells of the respiratory system. Chemical differences in the cell-surface receptors among hosts mean that a virus that infects a specific species (for example, humans) cannot infect another species (for example, chickens).</p> <p>However, viruses have very small amounts of DNA or RNA compared to humans, and, as a result, viral reproduction can occur rapidly. Viral reproduction invariably produces errors that can lead to changes in newly produced viruses; these changes mean that the viral proteins that interact with cell-surface receptors may evolve in such a way that they can bind to receptors in a new host. Such changes happen randomly and quite often in the reproductive cycle of a virus, but the changes only matter if a virus with new binding properties comes into contact with a suitable host. In the case of influenza, this situation can occur in settings where animals and people are in close contact, such as poultry and swine farms.&nbsp;Once a virus jumps to a new host, it can spread quickly. Scientists watch newly appearing viruses (called emerging viruses) closely in the hope that such monitoring can reduce the likelihood of global viral epidemics.</p> </div> <p>Cell-surface receptors are involved in most of the signaling in multicellular organisms. There are three general categories of cell-surface receptors: ion channel-linked receptors, G-protein-linked receptors, and enzyme-linked receptors.</p> <div id="attachment_1642" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1642" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02233345/Figure_09_01_04.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a gated ion channel that is closed in the absence of a signaling molecule.

Gated ion channels form a pore through the plasma membrane that opens when the signaling molecule binds. The open pore then allows ions to flow into or out of the cell.</p> </div> <p><strong>Ion channel-linked receptors </strong>bind a ligand and open a channel through the membrane that allows specific ions to pass through. To form a channel, this type of cell-surface receptor has an extensive membrane-spanning region. In order to interact with the phospholipid fatty acid tails that form the center of the plasma membrane, many of the amino acids in the membrane-spanning region are hydrophobic in nature. Conversely, the amino acids that line the inside of the channel are hydrophilic to allow for the passage of water or ions. When a ligand binds to the extracellular region of the channel, there is a conformational change in the proteins structure that allows ions such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, and hydrogen to pass through (Figure 5).</p> <p><strong>G-protein-linked receptors</strong> bind a ligand and activate a membrane protein called a G-protein. The activated G-protein then interacts with either an ion channel or an enzyme in the membrane (Figure 6). All G-protein-linked receptors have seven transmembrane domains, but each receptor has its own specific extracellular domain and G-protein-binding site.</p> <p>Cell signaling using G-protein-linked receptors occurs as a cyclic series of events. Before the ligand binds, the inactive G-protein can bind to a newly revealed site on the receptor specific for its binding. Once the G-protein binds to the receptor, the resultant shape change activates the G-protein, which releases GDP and picks up GTP.

In some cases, the intracellular domain of the receptor itself is an enzyme. Other enzyme-linked receptors have a small intracellular domain that interacts directly with an enzyme. The enzyme-linked receptors normally have large extracellular and intracellular domains, but the membrane-spanning region consists of a single alpha-helical region of the peptide strand. When a ligand binds to the extracellular domain, a signal is transferred through the membrane, activating the enzyme. Activation of the enzyme sets off a chain of events within the cell that eventually leads to a response. One example of this type of enzyme-linked receptor is the tyrosine kinase receptor (Figure 8). A kinase is an enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from ATP to another protein. The tyrosine kinase receptor transfers phosphate groups to tyrosine molecules (tyrosine residues). First, signaling molecules bind to the extracellular domain of two nearby tyrosine kinase receptors. The two neighboring receptors then bond together, or dimerize. Phosphates are then added to tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain of the receptors (phosphorylation). The phosphorylated residues can then transmit the signal to the next messenger within the cytoplasm.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <div id="attachment_1646" style="width: 479px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1646" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02233652/Figure_09_01_07.png" alt="This illustration shows two receptor tyrosine kinase monomers embedded in the plasma membrane.

Conformational changes of the extracellular domain upon ligand binding can propagate through the membrane region of the receptor and lead to activation of the intracellular domain or its associated proteins. In some cases, binding of the ligand causes&nbsp;<strong>dimerization</strong> of the receptor, which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer. A <strong>dimer</strong> is a chemical compound formed when two molecules (often identical) join together. The binding of the receptors in this manner enables their intracellular domains to come into close contact and activate each other.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>Learning Objectives</h3> <ul><li>Explain how the binding of a ligand initiates signal transduction throughout a cell</li> <li>Recognize the role of phosphorylation in the transmission of intracellular signals</li> <li>Evaluate the role of second messengers in signal transmission</li> </ul> </div> <h2>Binding Initiates a Signaling Pathway</h2> <p>After the ligand binds to the cell-surface receptor, the activation of the receptor’s intracellular components sets off a chain of events that is called a signaling pathway or a signaling cascade.

Apoptosis would be inhibited.</div> </div> </div> <p>Signaling pathways can get very complicated very quickly because most cellular proteins can affect different downstream events, depending on the conditions within the cell. A single pathway can branch off toward different endpoints based on the interplay between two or more signaling pathways, and the same ligands are often used to initiate different signals in different cell types. This variation in response is due to differences in protein expression in different cell types. Another complicating element is&nbsp;<strong>signal integration </strong>of the pathways, in which signals from two or more different cell-surface receptors merge to activate the same response in the cell. This process can ensure that multiple external requirements are met before a cell commits to a specific response.</p> <p>The effects of extracellular signals can also be amplified by enzymatic cascades. At the initiation of the signal, a single ligand binds to a single receptor. However, activation of a receptor-linked enzyme can activate many copies of a component of the signaling cascade, which amplifies the signal.</p> <h2>Methods of Intracellular Signaling</h2> <p>The induction of a signaling pathway depends on the modification of a cellular component by an enzyme. There are numerous enzymatic modifications that can occur, and they are recognized in turn by the next component downstream. The following are some of the more common events in intracellular signaling.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><a href="https://www.dnalc.org/resources/3d/cellsignals.html" target="_blank">Observe an animation of cell signaling at this&nbsp;site.</a></div> <h3>Phosphorylation</h3> <div id="attachment_1651" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1651" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02234315/Figure_09_02_02.jpg" alt="Molecular structures of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine are shown.

In protein phosphorylation, a phosphate group (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>−3</sup>) is added to residues of the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine.</p> </div> <p>One of the most common chemical modifications that occurs in signaling pathways is the addition of a phosphate group (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>–3</sup>) to a molecule such as a protein in a process called phosphorylation. The phosphate can be added to a nucleotide such as GMP to form GDP or GTP. Phosphates are also often added to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues of proteins, where they replace the hydroxyl group of the amino acid (Figure 2). The transfer of the phosphate is catalyzed by an enzyme called a <strong>kinase</strong>. Various kinases are named for the substrate they phosphorylate. Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues often activates enzymes. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues can either affect the activity of an enzyme or create a binding site that interacts with downstream components in the signaling cascade. Phosphorylation may activate or inactivate enzymes, and the reversal of phosphorylation, dephosphorylation by a phosphatase, will reverse the effect.</p> <h3>Second Messengers</h3> <p><strong>Second messengers</strong> are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling molecule to the receptor. These molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain cellular proteins.</p> <p>Calcium ion is a widely used second messenger. The free concentration of calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) within a cell is very low because ion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously use adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) to remove it. For signaling purposes, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. When signaling occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that are present outside the cell (or in intracellular storage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The response to the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> varies, depending on the cell type involved. For example, in the β-cells of the pancreas, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling leads to the release of insulin, and in muscle cells, an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to muscle contractions.</p> <p>Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is&nbsp;<strong>cyclic AMP (cAMP)</strong>. Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from ATP (Figure 3). The main role of cAMP in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme called cAMP-dependent kinase (A-kinase). A-kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways: It phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of its target proteins, activating them in the process. A-kinase is found in many different types of cells, and the target proteins in each kind of cell are different. Differences give rise to the variation of the responses to cAMP in different cells.</p> <div id="attachment_1653" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1653" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02234419/Figure_09_02_031.jpg" alt="Cyclic AMP is made from ATP by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase.

The chain of events that conveys the signal through the cell is called a signaling pathway or cascade. Signaling pathways are often very complex because of the interplay between different proteins. A major component of cell signaling cascades is the phosphorylation of molecules by enzymes known as kinases. Phosphorylation adds a phosphate group to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in a protein, changing their shapes, and activating or inactivating the protein. Small molecules like nucleotides can also be phosphorylated. Second messengers are small, non-protein molecules that are used to transmit a signal within a cell. Some examples of second messengers are calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), cyclic AMP (cAMP), diacylglycerol (DAG), and inositol triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>).</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

Others regulate the translation of proteins from mRNA. An example of a protein that regulates translation in the nucleus is the MAP kinase ERK.

ERK is a MAP kinase that activates translation when it is phosphorylated. ERK phosphorylates MNK1, which in turn phosphorylates eIF-4E, an elongation initiation factor that, with other initiation factors, is associated with mRNA. When eIF-4E becomes phosphorylated, the mRNA unfolds, allowing protein synthesis in the nucleus to begin.</p> </div> <p>The second kind of protein with which PKC can interact is a protein that acts as an inhibitor. An&nbsp;<strong>inhibitor</strong> is a molecule that binds to a protein and prevents it from functioning or reduces its function. In this case, the inhibitor is a protein called Iκ-B, which binds to the regulatory protein NF-κB. (The symbol κ represents the Greek letter kappa.) When Iκ-B is bound to NF-κB, the complex cannot enter the nucleus of the cell, but when Iκ-B is phosphorylated by PKC, it can no longer bind NF-κB, and NF-κB (a transcription factor) can enter the nucleus and initiate RNA transcription. In this case, the effect of phosphorylation is to inactivate an inhibitor and thereby activate the process of transcription.</p> <h2>Increase in Cellular Metabolism</h2> <p>The result of another signaling pathway affects muscle cells. The activation of β-adrenergic receptors in muscle cells by adrenaline leads to an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) inside the cell. Also known as epinephrine, adrenaline is a hormone (produced by the adrenal gland attached to the kidney) that readies the body for short-term emergencies. Cyclic AMP activates PKA (protein kinase A), which in turn phosphorylates two enzymes. The first enzyme promotes the degradation of glycogen by activating intermediate glycogen phosphorylase kinase (GPK) that in turn activates glycogen phosphorylase (GP) that catabolizes glycogen into glucose. (Note that your body converts excess glucose to glycogen for short-term storage. When energy is needed, glycogen is quickly reconverted to glucose.) Phosphorylation of the second enzyme, glycogen synthase (GS), inhibits its ability to form glycogen from glucose. In this manner, a muscle cell obtains a ready pool of glucose by activating its formation via glycogen degradation and by inhibiting the use of glucose to form glycogen, thus preventing a futile cycle of glycogen degradation and synthesis. The glucose is then available for use by the muscle cell in response to a sudden surge of adrenaline—the “fight or flight” reflex.</p> <h2>Cell Growth</h2> <p>Cell signaling pathways also play a major role in cell division. Cells do not normally divide unless they are stimulated by signals from other cells. The ligands that promote cell growth are called&nbsp;<strong>growth factors</strong>. Most growth factors bind to cell-surface receptors that are linked to tyrosine kinases. These cell-surface receptors are called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Activation of RTKs initiates a signaling pathway that includes a G-protein called RAS, which activates the MAP kinase pathway described earlier. The enzyme MAP kinase then stimulates the expression of proteins that interact with other cellular components to initiate cell division.</p> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>Cancer Biology</h3> <p>Cancer biologists study the molecular origins of cancer with the goal of developing new prevention methods and treatment strategies that will inhibit the growth of tumors without harming the normal cells of the body. As mentioned earlier, signaling pathways control cell growth. These signaling pathways are controlled by signaling proteins, which are, in turn, expressed by genes. Mutations in these genes can result in malfunctioning signaling proteins. This prevents the cell from regulating its cell cycle, triggering unrestricted cell division and cancer. The genes that regulate the signaling proteins are one type of oncogene, which is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer. The gene encoding RAS is an oncogene that was originally discovered when mutations in the RAS protein were linked to cancer. Further studies have indicated that 30 percent of cancer cells have a mutation in the RAS gene that leads to uncontrolled growth. If left unchecked, uncontrolled cell division can lead tumor formation and metastasis, the growth of cancer cells in new locations in the body.</p> <p>Cancer biologists have been able to identify many other oncogenes that contribute to the development of cancer. For example, HER2 is a cell-surface receptor that is present in excessive amounts in 20 percent of human breast cancers. Cancer biologists realized that gene duplication led to HER2 overexpression in 25 percent of breast cancer patients and developed a drug called Herceptin (trastuzumab). Herceptin is a monoclonal antibody that targets HER2 for removal by the immune system. Herceptin therapy helps to control signaling through HER2. The use of Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy has helped to increase the overall survival rate of patients with metastatic breast cancer.</p> <p><a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research" target="_blank">More information on cancer biology research can be found at the&nbsp;National Cancer Institute website.</a></p> </div> <h2>Cell Death</h2> <p>When a cell is damaged, superfluous, or potentially dangerous to an organism, a cell can initiate a mechanism to trigger programmed cell death, or&nbsp;<strong>apoptosis</strong>. Apoptosis allows a cell to die in a controlled manner that prevents the release of potentially damaging molecules from inside the cell. There are many internal checkpoints that monitor a cell’s health; if abnormalities are observed, a cell can spontaneously initiate the process of apoptosis. However, in some cases, such as a viral infection or uncontrolled cell division due to cancer, the cell’s normal checks and balances fail. External signaling can also initiate apoptosis. For example, most normal animal cells have receptors that interact with the extracellular matrix, a network of glycoproteins that provides structural support for cells in an organism. The binding of cellular receptors to the extracellular matrix initiates a signaling cascade within the cell. However, if the cell moves away from the extracellular matrix, the signaling ceases, and the cell undergoes apoptosis. This system keeps cells from traveling through the body and proliferating out of control, as happens with tumor cells that metastasize.</p> <div id="attachment_1659" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1659" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02234748/Figure_09_03_02.jpg" alt="This photo shows a histological section of a foot of a 15-day-old mouse embryo.

The histological section of a foot of a 15-day-old mouse embryo, visualized using light microscopy, reveals areas of tissue between the toes, which apoptosis will eliminate before the mouse reaches its full gestational age at 27 days. (credit: modification of work by Michal Mañas)</p> </div> <p>Another example of external signaling that leads to apoptosis occurs in T-cell development. T-cells are immune cells that bind to foreign macromolecules and particles, and target them for destruction by the immune system. Normally, T-cells do not target “self” proteins (those of their own organism), a process that can lead to autoimmune diseases. In order to develop the ability to discriminate between self and non-self, immature T-cells undergo screening to determine whether they bind to so-called self proteins. If the T-cell receptor binds to self proteins, the cell initiates apoptosis to remove the potentially dangerous cell.</p> <p>Apoptosis is also essential for normal embryological development. In vertebrates, for example, early stages of development include the formation of web-like tissue between individual fingers and toes (Figure 2). During the course of normal development, these unneeded cells must be eliminated, enabling fully separated fingers and toes to form. A cell signaling mechanism triggers apoptosis, which destroys the cells between the developing digits.</p> <h3>Termination of the Signal Cascade</h3> <p>The aberrant signaling often seen in tumor cells is proof that the termination of a signal at the appropriate time can be just as important as the initiation of a signal. One method of stopping a specific signal is to degrade the ligand or remove it so that it can no longer access its receptor. One reason that hydrophobic hormones like estrogen and testosterone trigger long-lasting events is because they bind carrier proteins. These proteins allow the insoluble molecules to be soluble in blood, but they also protect the hormones from degradation by circulating enzymes.</p> <p>Inside the cell, many different enzymes reverse the cellular modifications that result from signaling cascades. For example, <strong>phosphatases </strong>are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in a process called dephosphorylation. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is degraded into AMP by <strong>phosphodiesterase</strong>, and the release of calcium stores is reversed by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>In Summary: Response to the Signal</h3> <p>Many pathways influence the cell by initiating gene expression, and the methods utilized are quite numerous. Some pathways activate enzymes that interact with DNA transcription factors. Others modify proteins and induce them to change their location in the cell. Depending on the status of the organism, cells can respond by storing energy as glycogen or fat, or making it available in the form of glucose. A signal transduction pathway allows muscle cells to respond to immediate requirements for energy in the form of glucose. Cell growth is almost always stimulated by external signals called growth factors. Uncontrolled cell growth leads to cancer, and mutations in the genes encoding protein components of signaling pathways are often found in tumor cells.</p> <p>Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is important for removing damaged or unnecessary cells. The use of cellular signaling to organize the dismantling of a cell ensures that harmful molecules from the cytoplasm are not released into the spaces between cells, as they are in uncontrolled death, necrosis. Apoptosis also ensures the efficient recycling of the components of the dead cell. Termination of the cellular signaling cascade is very important so that the response to a signal is appropriate in both timing and intensity. Degradation of signaling molecules and dephosphorylation of phosphorylated intermediates of the pathway by phosphatases are two ways to terminate signals within the cell.</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

Micrograph of budding <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> yeast cells.</p> </div> <p>Yeasts are eukaryotes (fungi), and the components and processes found in yeast signals are similar to those of cell-surface receptor signals in multicellular organisms.

While some external signaling occurs between different species of single-celled organisms, the majority of signaling within bacteria and yeasts concerns only other members of the same species. The evolution of cellular communication is an absolute necessity for the development of multicellular organisms, and this innovation is thought to have required approximately 2.5 billion years to appear in early life forms.</p> <p>Yeasts are single-celled eukaryotes, and therefore have a nucleus and organelles characteristic of more complex life forms. Comparisons of the genomes of yeasts, nematode worms, fruit flies, and humans illustrate the evolution of increasingly complex signaling systems that allow for the efficient inner workings that keep humans and other complex life forms functioning correctly.</p> <p>Kinases are a major component of cellular communication, and studies of these enzymes illustrate the evolutionary connectivity of different species. Yeasts have 130 types of kinases. More complex organisms such as nematode worms and fruit flies have 454 and 239 kinases, respectively. Of the 130 kinase types in yeast, 97 belong to the 55 subfamilies of kinases that are found in other eukaryotic organisms. The only obvious deficiency seen in yeasts is the complete absence of tyrosine kinases. It is hypothesized that phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is needed to control the more sophisticated functions of development, differentiation, and cellular communication used in multicellular organisms.</p> <p>Because yeasts contain many of the same classes of signaling proteins as humans, these organisms are ideal for studying signaling cascades. Yeasts multiply quickly and are much simpler organisms than humans or other multicellular animals. Therefore, the signaling cascades are also simpler and easier to study, although they contain similar counterparts to human signaling.<span class="footnote">G. Manning, G.D. Plowman, T. Hunter, S.

<h2>Signaling in Bacteria</h2>
<p>Signaling in bacteria enables bacteria to monitor extracellular conditions, ensure that there are sufficient amounts of nutrients, and ensure that hazardous situations are avoided. There are circumstances, however, when bacteria communicate with each other.</p>
<p>The first evidence of bacterial communication was observed in a bacterium that has a symbiotic relationship with Hawaiian bobtail squid. When the population density of the bacteria reaches a certain level, specific gene expression is initiated, and the bacteria produce bioluminescent proteins that emit light. Because the number of cells present in the environment (cell density) is the determining factor for signaling, bacterial signaling was named <strong>quorum sensing</strong>. In politics and business, a quorum is the minimum number of members required to be present to vote on an issue.</p>
<p>Quorum sensing uses autoinducers as signaling molecules. <strong>Autoinducers</strong> are signaling molecules secreted by bacteria to communicate with other bacteria of the same kind. The secreted autoinducers can be small, hydrophobic molecules such as acyl-homoserine lactone, (AHL) or larger peptide-based molecules; each type of molecule has a different mode of action. When AHL enters target bacteria, it binds to transcription factors, which then switch gene expression on or off (see Figure 2). The peptide autoinducers stimulate more complicated signaling pathways that include bacterial kinases. The changes in bacteria following exposure to autoinducers can be quite extensive. The pathogenic bacterium <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> has 616 different genes that respond to autoinducers.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Some species of bacteria that use quorum sensing form biofilms, complex colonies of bacteria (often containing several species) that exchange chemical signals to coordinate the release of toxins that will attack the host. Bacterial biofilms (Figure 3) can sometimes be found on medical equipment; when biofilms invade implants such as hip or knee replacements or heart pacemakers, they can cause life-threatening infections.</p>
<p>Cell-cell communication enables <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> bacteria (Figure 3a) to work together to form a biofilm inside a hospital patient’s catheter, seen here via scanning electron microscopy. <em>S. aureus</em> is the main cause of hospital-acquired infections. Hawaiian bobtail squid (Figure 3b) have a symbiotic relationship with the bioluminescent bacteria <em>Vibrio fischeri</em>. The luminescence makes it difficult to see the squid from below because it effectively eliminates its shadow. In return for camouflage, the squid provides food for the bacteria. Free-living <em>V. fischeri</em> do not produce luciferase, the enzyme responsible for luminescence, but <em>V. fischeri</em> living in a symbiotic relationship with the squid do. Quorum sensing determines whether the bacteria should produce the luciferase enzyme.</p>

In order for our bodies to grow and develop, they must produce new cells—and allow for the death of old cells. Cell division is also an essential component of injury repair. If our cells couldn&#8217;t divide and create new cells, our bodies could never produce new skin cells to heal road rash, or grow a fingernail back. However, when cell division goes awry, dramatic results may occur. Without sufficient cellular oversight, repeated rounds of unregulated cell division can lead to a minor condition like psoriasis or a life-threatening disease like cancer. Cell division takes occurs by a strict cycle, with multiple stages and checkpoints to ensure things <em>don&#8217;t</em> go awry.</p> <p>Perhaps most importantly, without cell division, no species would be able to reproduce—life would simply end (or would have ended a long time ago). Every human, as well as every sexually reproducing organism, begins life as a fertilized egg (embryo) or zygote. Trillions of cell divisions subsequently occur in a controlled manner to produce a complex, multicellular human. In other words, that original single cell is the ancestor of every other cell in the body. Single-celled organisms use cell division as their method of reproduction.</p> <div id="attachment_3926" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-3926" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/16221223/Figure_10_00_02abc-1024x260.jpg" alt="Image A shows two conjoined cells forming a dumbbell shape; the fertilization envelope has been removed so that the mesh-like outer layer can be seen.

But what exactly is this genetic material, and how does it behave over the course of a cell division?</p> <h2>DNA and Genomes</h2> <p><strong>DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)</strong> is the genetic material of living organisms. In humans, DNA is found in almost all the cells of the body and provides the instructions they need to grow, function, and respond to their environment. When a cell of the body divides, it will pass on a copy of its DNA to each of its daughter cells. DNA is also passed on at the at the level of organisms, with the DNA in sperm and egg cells combining to form a new organism that has genetic material from both its parents. Physically speaking, DNA is a long string of paired chemical units (nucleotides) that come in four different types, and it carries information organized into units called genes. Genes typically provide instructions for making proteins, which give cells and organisms their functional characteristics.</p> <p><img class="alignright wp-image-2485" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02153920/DNAtypes-1024x763.png" alt="Image of a eukaryotic cell, showing the nuclear DNA (in the nucleus), the mitochondrial DNA (in the mitochondrial matrix, and the chloroplast DNA (in the stroma of the chloroplast." width="400" height="298" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02153920/DNAtypes-1024x763.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02153920/DNAtypes-300x224.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02153920/DNAtypes-768x572.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02153920/DNAtypes-65x48.png 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02153920/DNAtypes-225x168.png 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02153920/DNAtypes-350x261.png 350w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02153920/DNAtypes.png 1158w" />In eukaryotes such as plants and animals, the great majority of DNA is found in the nucleus and is called <strong>nuclear DNA</strong>. Mitochondria, organelles that harvest energy for the cell, contain their own <strong>mitochondrial DNA</strong>, and chloroplasts, organelles that carry out photosynthesis in plant cells, also have <strong>chloroplast DNA</strong>. The amounts of DNA found in mitochondria and chloroplasts are much smaller than the amount found in the nucleus. In bacteria and other prokaryotes, most of the DNA is found in a central region of the cell called the <strong>nucleoid</strong>, which functions similarly to a nucleus but is not surrounded by a membrane.</p> <p>A cell’s set of DNA is called its <strong>genome</strong>. Since all of the cells in an organism (with a few exceptions) contain the same DNA, you can also say that an organism has its own genome, and since the members of a species typically have similar genomes, you can also describe the genome of a species. In general, when people refer to the human genome, or any other eukaryotic genome, they mean the set of DNA found in the nucleus (that is, the nuclear genome). Mitochondria and chloroplasts are considered to have their own separate genomes.</p> <h2>Chromosomes</h2> <p>Each species has its own characteristic number of chromosomes. Humans, for instance, have 46 chromosomes in a typical body cell, while dogs have 78. Like many species of animals and plants, humans are <strong>diploid (2<em>n</em>)</strong>, meaning that most of their chromosomes come in matched sets known as <strong>homologous pairs</strong>. Thus, the 46 chromosomes of a human cell are organized into 23 pairs, and the two members of each pair are said to be <strong>homologues</strong> of one another (with the slight exception of the X and Y chromosomes; see below).</p> <p>Human sperm and eggs, which have only one homologous chromosome from each pair, are said to be <strong>haploid (1<em>n</em>)</strong>. When a sperm and egg fuse, their genetic material combines to form one complete, diploid set of chromosomes. So, for each homologous pair of chromosomes in your genome, one of the homologues comes from your mom and the other from your dad.</p> <div id="attachment_3858" style="width: 721px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-3858" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/08001845/karyotype.jpg" alt="Image of the karyotype of a human male, with chromosomes from the mother and father false-colored purple and green, respectively." width="711" height="517" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/08001845/karyotype.jpg 711w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/08001845/karyotype-300x218.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/08001845/karyotype-65x47.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/08001845/karyotype-225x164.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/08001845/karyotype-350x255.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Image modified from “<a href="http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=114" target="_blank">Karyotype</a>,” by the National Institutes of Health (public domain).</p> </div> <p>The two chromosomes in a homologous pair are generally very similar to one another. They’re the same size and shape, and have the same pattern of light and dark bands, as you can see in the human <strong>karyotype</strong> (image of the chromosomes) shown above. Bands appear when the chromosomes are stained with a dye, and the dark bands mark more compacted DNA (usually, with fewer genes), while the light bands mark less compacted DNA (usually, with more genes). Most importantly, the two homologues in a pair carry the same type of genetic information. For instance, there is a gene found near the bottom of chromosome 15 that affects eye color<span class="footnote">The Tech Museum of Innovation. (2013). Don’t it make your brown eyes blue? In <em>Stanford at the tech: understanding genetics</em>.

A person might have the blue version, or <strong>allele</strong>, of this gene on one homologue, but the brown version on the other. Both homologues have the same type of gene in the same place, but they can (and often do!) have different versions of genes.</p> <p>In humans, the X and Y chromosomes determine a person’s biological sex, with XX for female and XY for male. While the two X chromosomes in a woman’s cells are genuinely homologous, the X and Y chromosomes of a man’s cells are not. They differ in size and shape, with the X being much larger than the Y, and contain different mostly different genes (although they do have small regions of similarity). The X and Y chromosomes are known as <strong>sex chromosomes</strong>, while the other 44 human chromosomes are called <strong>autosomes</strong>.</p> <h2>Chromosome Structure</h2> <p>The continuity of life from one cell to another has its foundation in the reproduction of cells by way of the cell cycle. The&nbsp;<strong>cell cycle</strong> is an orderly sequence of events that describes the stages of a cell’s life from the division of a single parent cell to the production of two new daughter cells. The mechanisms involved in the cell cycle are highly regulated.</p> <h3>Eukaryotic Chromosomal Structure and Compaction</h3> <p>If the DNA from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out end to end, it would measure approximately two meters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm. Considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 µm (100,000 cells lined up to equal one meter), DNA must be tightly packaged to fit in the cell’s nucleus. At the same time, it must also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed. During some stages of the cell cycle, the long strands of DNA are condensed into compact chromosomes. There are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted.</p> <p>In the first level of compaction, short stretches of the DNA double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome (Figure 1). The DNA-histone complex is called chromatin. The beadlike, histone DNA complex is called a nucleosome, and DNA connecting the nucleosomes is called linker DNA. A DNA molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a DNA double helix. The next level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker DNA between them are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. This coiling further shortens the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form. In the third level of packing, a variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin. These fibrous proteins also ensure that each chromosome in a non-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that does not overlap with that of any other chromosome.</p> <div id="attachment_1794" style="width: 593px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1794" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03204339/Figure_10_01_03.jpg" alt="There are five levels of chromosome organization.

Interphase is followed by the mitotic cycle, mitosis and cytokinesis. Mitosis is a process in which a diploid cell nucleus divides itself (duplicates) into 2 diploid nuclei. The first stage is prophase, during which the nucleus begins to disappear. The next stage is metaphase. During this phase, all sister chromatids are aligned in the center of the cell. Next is anaphase. During this phase, the sister chromosomes are all split. Next is telophase. A new nucleus is formed around each set of chromatids. The two nuclei are divided from each other, creating two new cells in a process called cytokinesis.

In order for a cell to move from interphase into the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met. The three stages of interphase are called G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub>.</p> <h3>G<sub>1</sub> Phase (First Gap)</h3> <p>The first stage of interphase is called the&nbsp;<strong>G<sub>1</sub> phase</strong> (first gap) because, from a microscopic aspect, little change is visible. However, during the G<sub>1</sub> stage, the cell is quite active at the biochemical level. The cell is accumulating the building blocks of chromosomal DNA and the associated proteins as well as accumulating sufficient energy reserves to complete the task of replicating each chromosome in the nucleus.</p> <h3>S Phase (Synthesis of DNA)</h3> <p>Throughout interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed chromatin configuration. In the&nbsp;<strong>S phase</strong>, DNA replication can proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of DNA molecules—sister chromatids—that are firmly attached to the centromeric region. The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase. The two centrosomes will give rise to the <strong>mitotic spindle</strong>, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis. At the center of each animal cell, the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with a pair of rod-like objects, the <strong>centrioles</strong>, which are at right angles to each other. Centrioles help organize cell division. Centrioles are not present in the centrosomes of other eukaryotic species, such as plants and most fungi.</p> <h3>G<sub>2</sub> Phase (Second Gap)</h3> <p>In the&nbsp;<strong>G<sub>2</sub> phase</strong>, the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation. Some cell organelles are duplicated, and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the mitotic phase. There may be additional cell growth during G<sub>2</sub>. The final preparations for the mitotic phase must be completed before the cell is able to enter the first stage of mitosis.</p> <h2>Mitosis</h2> <p>The mitotic phase (also known as M phase) is a multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned, separated, and move into two new, identical daughter cells. The first portion of the mitotic phase is called&nbsp;<strong>karyokinesis</strong>, or nuclear division. The second portion of the mitotic phase, called cytokinesis, is the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into the two daughter cells.</p> <p>Karyokinesis, also known as mitosis, is divided into a series of phases—prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase—that result in the division of the cell (Figure 2).</p> <div id="attachment_3975" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-3975" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/22183146/Mitosis_cells_sequence_names-1024x515.jpg" alt="The cell cycle, with each step labelled.

The remnants of the nuclear envelope fragment. The mitotic spindle continues to develop as more microtubules assemble and stretch across the length of the former nuclear area. Chromosomes become more condensed and discrete. Each sister chromatid develops a protein structure called a kinetochore in the centromeric region (Figure 3). The proteins of the kinetochore attract and bind mitotic spindle microtubules. As the spindle microtubules extend from the centrosomes, some of these microtubules come into contact with and firmly bind to the kinetochores. Once a mitotic fiber attaches to a chromosome, the chromosome will be oriented until the kinetochores of sister chromatids face the opposite poles. Eventually, all the sister chromatids will be attached via their kinetochores to microtubules from opposing poles. Spindle microtubules that do not engage the chromosomes are called polar microtubules. These microtubules overlap each other midway between the two poles and contribute to cell elongation. Astral microtubules are located near the poles, aid in spindle orientation, and are required for the regulation of mitosis.</p> <p>During&nbsp;<strong>metaphase</strong>, the “change phase,” all the chromosomes are aligned in a plane called the <strong>metaphase plate</strong>, or the equatorial plane, midway between the two poles of the cell. The sister chromatids are still tightly attached to each other by cohesin proteins. At this time, the chromosomes are maximally condensed.</p> <p>During&nbsp;<strong>anaphase</strong>, the “upward phase,” the cohesin proteins degrade, and the sister chromatids separate at the centromere. Each chromatid, now called a chromosome, is pulled rapidly toward the centrosome to which its microtubule is attached. The cell becomes visibly elongated (oval shaped) as the polar microtubules slide against each other at the metaphase plate where they overlap.</p> <p>During&nbsp;<strong>telophase</strong>, the “distance phase,” the chromosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to decondense (unravel), relaxing into a chromatin configuration. The mitotic spindles are depolymerized into tubulin monomers that will be used to assemble cytoskeletal components for each daughter cell. Nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes, and nucleosomes appear within the nuclear area.</p> <p>The activity below will walk you through mitosis—providing you with the chance to review the different steps of the process&nbsp;and how they work together.</p> <p></p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The mitotic phase consists of mitosis, in which the nuclear chromatin is divided, and cytokinesis, in which the cytoplasm is divided, resulting in two daughter cells." width="800" height="561" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03204627/Figure_10_02_01.jpg 800w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03204627/Figure_10_02_01-300x210.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03204627/Figure_10_02_01-768x539.jpg 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03204627/Figure_10_02_01-65x46.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03204627/Figure_10_02_01-225x158.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03204627/Figure_10_02_01-350x245.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 5.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-cell-cycle-checkpoints"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">62</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Cell Cycle Checkpoints</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <h2>Identify and explain the important checkpoints that a cell passes through during the cell cycle</h2> <p>As we just learned, the cell cycle is a fairly complicated process.&nbsp;In order to make sure everything goes right, there are checkpoints in the cycle. Let’s learn about these and how they help control the cell cycle.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>Learning Objectives</h3> <ul><li>Identify important checkpoints in cell division</li> <li>Explain how errors in cell division are related to cancer</li> </ul> </div> <p>The length of the cell cycle is highly variable, even within the cells of a single organism. In humans, the frequency of cell turnover ranges from a few hours in early embryonic development, to an average of two to five days for epithelial cells, and to an entire human lifetime spent in G<sub>0</sub> by specialized cells, such as cortical neurons or cardiac muscle cells. There is also variation in the time that a cell spends in each phase of the cell cycle. When fast-dividing mammalian cells are grown in culture (outside the body under optimal growing conditions), the length of the cycle is about 24 hours. In rapidly dividing human cells with a 24-hour cell cycle, the G<sub>1</sub> phase lasts approximately nine hours, the S phase lasts 10 hours, the G<sub>2</sub> phase lasts about four and one-half hours, and the M phase lasts approximately one-half hour. In early embryos of fruit flies, the cell cycle is completed in about eight minutes. The timing of events in the cell cycle is controlled by mechanisms that are both internal and external to the cell.</p> <h2>Regulation of the Cell Cycle by External Events</h2> <p>Both the initiation and inhibition of cell division are triggered by events external to the cell when it is about to begin the replication process. An event may be as simple as the death of a nearby cell or as sweeping as the release of growth-promoting hormones, such as human growth hormone (HGH). A lack of HGH can inhibit cell division, resulting in dwarfism, whereas too much HGH can result in gigantism. Crowding of cells can also inhibit cell division. Another factor that can initiate cell division is the size of the cell; as a cell grows, it becomes inefficient due to its decreasing surface-to-volume ratio. The solution to this problem is to divide.</p> <p>Whatever the source of the message, the cell receives the signal, and a series of events within the cell allows it to proceed into interphase. Moving forward from this initiation point, every parameter required during each cell cycle phase must be met or the cycle cannot progress.</p> <h2>Regulation at Internal Checkpoints</h2> <p>It is essential that the daughter cells produced be exact duplicates of the parent cell. Mistakes in the duplication or distribution of the chromosomes lead to mutations that may be passed forward to every new cell produced from an abnormal cell. To prevent a compromised cell from continuing to divide, there are internal control mechanisms that operate at three main cell cycle checkpoints. A checkpoint is one of several points in the eukaryotic cell cycle at which the progression of a cell to the next stage in the cycle can be halted until conditions are favorable. These checkpoints occur near the end of G<sub>1</sub>, at the G<sub>2</sub>/M transition, and during metaphase (Figure&nbsp;1).</p> <div id="attachment_1807" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1807" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03210034/Figure_10_03_01.jpg" alt="This illustration shows the three major checkpoints of the cell cycle: G_{1}, G_{2}, and M." width="800" height="611" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03210034/Figure_10_03_01.jpg 800w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03210034/Figure_10_03_01-300x229.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03210034/Figure_10_03_01-768x587.jpg 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03210034/Figure_10_03_01-65x50.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03210034/Figure_10_03_01-225x172.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03210034/Figure_10_03_01-350x267.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure&nbsp;1. The cell cycle is controlled at three checkpoints. The integrity of the DNA is assessed at the G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint. Proper chromosome duplication is assessed at the G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint. Attachment of each kinetochore to a spindle fiber is assessed at the M checkpoint.</p> </div> <h3>The G<sub>1</sub> Checkpoint</h3> <p>The G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint determines whether all conditions are favorable for cell division to proceed. The G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint, also called the restriction point (in yeast), is a point at which the cell irreversibly commits to the cell division process. External influences, such as growth factors, play a large role in carrying the cell past the G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint. In addition to adequate reserves and cell size, there is a check for genomic DNA damage at the G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint. A cell that does not meet all the requirements will not be allowed to progress into the S phase. The cell can halt the cycle and attempt to remedy the problematic condition, or the cell can advance into G<sub>0</sub> and await further signals when conditions improve.</p> <h3>The G<sub>2</sub> Checkpoint</h3> <p>The G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint bars entry into the mitotic phase if certain conditions are not met. As at the G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint, cell size and protein reserves are assessed. However, the most important role of the G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint is to ensure that all of the chromosomes have been replicated and that the replicated DNA is not damaged. If the checkpoint mechanisms detect problems with the DNA, the cell cycle is halted, and the cell attempts to either complete DNA replication or repair the damaged DNA.</p> <h3>The M Checkpoint</h3> <p>The M checkpoint occurs near the end of the metaphase stage of karyokinesis. The M checkpoint is also known as the spindle checkpoint, because it determines whether all the sister chromatids are correctly attached to the spindle microtubules. Because the separation of the sister chromatids during anaphase is an irreversible step, the cycle will not proceed until the kinetochores of each pair of sister chromatids are firmly anchored to at least two spindle fibers arising from opposite poles of the cell.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">Watch what occurs at the G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>, and M checkpoints by <a href="http://outreach.mcb.harvard.edu/animations/checkpoints.swf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downloading this animation of the cell cycle</a>.</div> <h2>Regulator Molecules of the Cell Cycle</h2> <p>In addition to the internally controlled checkpoints, there are two groups of intracellular molecules that regulate the cell cycle. These regulatory molecules either promote progress of the cell to the next phase (positive regulation) or halt the cycle (negative regulation). Regulator molecules may act individually, or they can influence the activity or production of other regulatory proteins. Therefore, the failure of a single regulator may have almost no effect on the cell cycle, especially if more than one mechanism controls the same event. Conversely, the effect of a deficient or non-functioning regulator can be wide-ranging and possibly fatal to the cell if multiple processes are affected.</p> <h3>Positive Regulation of the Cell Cycle</h3> <p>Two groups of proteins, called cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), are responsible for the progress of the cell through the various checkpoints. The levels of the four cyclin proteins fluctuate throughout the cell cycle in a predictable pattern (Figure&nbsp;2). Increases in the concentration of cyclin proteins are triggered by both external and internal signals. After the cell moves to the next stage of the cell cycle, the cyclins that were active in the previous stage are degraded.</p> <div id="attachment_1669" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1669 size-full" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02235459/Figure_10_03_02.jpg" alt="This graph shows the concentrations of different cyclin proteins during various phases of the cell cycle.

The concentrations of cyclin proteins change throughout the cell cycle. There is a direct correlation between cyclin accumulation and the three major cell cycle checkpoints. Also note the sharp decline of cyclin levels following each checkpoint (the transition between phases of the cell cycle), as cyclin is degraded by cytoplasmic enzymes. (credit: modification of work by “WikiMiMa”/Wikimedia Commons)</p> </div> <p>Cyclins regulate the cell cycle only when they are tightly bound to Cdks. To be fully active, the Cdk/cyclin complex must also be phosphorylated in specific locations. Like all kinases, Cdks are enzymes (kinases) that phosphorylate other proteins. Phosphorylation activates the protein by changing its shape. The proteins phosphorylated by Cdks are involved in advancing the cell to the next phase (Figure&nbsp;3). The levels of Cdk proteins are relatively stable throughout the cell cycle; however, the concentrations of cyclin fluctuate and determine when Cdk/cyclin complexes form. The different cyclins and Cdks bind at specific points in the cell cycle and thus regulate different checkpoints.</p> <div id="attachment_1808" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1808" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03210900/Figure_10_03_03_prev1.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a cyclin protein binding to a Cdk.

Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are protein kinases that, when fully activated, can phosphorylate and thus activate other proteins that advance the cell cycle past a checkpoint. To become fully activated, a Cdk must bind to a cyclin protein and then be phosphorylated by another kinase.</p> </div> <p>Since the cyclic fluctuations of cyclin levels are based on the timing of the cell cycle and not on specific events, regulation of the cell cycle usually occurs by either the Cdk molecules alone or the Cdk/cyclin complexes. Without a specific concentration of fully activated cyclin/Cdk complexes, the cell cycle cannot proceed through the checkpoints.</p> <p>Although the cyclins are the main regulatory molecules that determine the forward momentum of the cell cycle, there are several other mechanisms that fine-tune the progress of the cycle with negative, rather than positive, effects. These mechanisms essentially block the progression of the cell cycle until problematic conditions are resolved. Molecules that prevent the full activation of Cdks are called Cdk inhibitors. Many of these inhibitor molecules directly or indirectly monitor a particular cell cycle event. The block placed on Cdks by inhibitor molecules will not be removed until the specific event that the inhibitor monitors is completed.</p> <h3>Negative Regulation of the Cell Cycle</h3> <p>The second group of cell cycle regulatory molecules are negative regulators. Negative regulators halt the cell cycle. Remember that in positive regulation, active molecules cause the cycle to progress.</p> <p>The best understood negative regulatory molecules are retinoblastoma protein (Rb), p53, and p21. Retinoblastoma proteins are a group of tumor-suppressor proteins common in many cells. The 53 and 21 designations refer to the functional molecular masses of the proteins (p) in kilodaltons. Much of what is known about cell cycle regulation comes from research conducted with cells that have lost regulatory control. All three of these regulatory proteins were discovered to be damaged or non-functional in cells that had begun to replicate uncontrollably (became cancerous). In each case, the main cause of the unchecked progress through the cell cycle was a faulty copy of the regulatory protein.</p> <p>Rb, p53, and p21 act primarily at the G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint. p53 is a multi-functional protein that has a major impact on the commitment of a cell to division because it acts when there is damaged DNA in cells that are undergoing the preparatory processes during G<sub>1</sub>. If damaged DNA is detected, p53 halts the cell cycle and recruits enzymes to repair the DNA. If the DNA cannot be repaired, p53 can trigger apoptosis, or cell suicide, to prevent the duplication of damaged chromosomes. As p53 levels rise, the production of p21 is triggered. p21 enforces the halt in the cycle dictated by p53 by binding to and inhibiting the activity of the Cdk/cyclin complexes. As a cell is exposed to more stress, higher levels of p53 and p21 accumulate, making it less likely that the cell will move into the S phase.</p> <p>Rb exerts its regulatory influence on other positive regulator proteins. Chiefly, Rb monitors cell size. In the active, dephosphorylated state, Rb binds to proteins called transcription factors, most commonly, E2F (Figure&nbsp;4). Transcription factors “turn on” specific genes, allowing the production of proteins encoded by that gene. When Rb is bound to E2F, production of proteins necessary for the G<sub>1</sub>/S transition is blocked. As the cell increases in size, Rb is slowly phosphorylated until it becomes inactivated. Rb releases E2F, which can now turn on the gene that produces the transition protein, and this particular block is removed. For the cell to move past each of the checkpoints, all positive regulators must be “turned on,” and all negative regulators must be “turned off.”</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <div id="attachment_1809" style="width: 738px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1809" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03210952/Figure_10_03_041.png" alt="This illustration shows the regulation of the cell cycle by the Rb protein.

Mutations that prevent these proteins from carrying out their function can result in cancer.</div> </div> </div> <h2>Cancer and the Cell Cycle</h2> <p>Cancer comprises many different diseases caused by a common mechanism: uncontrolled cell growth. Despite the redundancy and overlapping levels of cell cycle control, errors do occur. One of the critical processes monitored by the cell cycle checkpoint surveillance mechanism is the proper replication of DNA during the S phase. Even when all of the cell cycle controls are fully functional, a small percentage of replication errors (mutations) will be passed on to the daughter cells. If changes to the DNA nucleotide sequence occur within a coding portion of a gene and are not corrected, a gene mutation results. All cancers start when a gene mutation gives rise to a faulty protein that plays a key role in cell reproduction. The change in the cell that results from the malformed protein may be minor: perhaps a slight delay in the binding of Cdk to cyclin or an Rb protein that detaches from its target DNA while still phosphorylated. Even minor mistakes, however, may allow subsequent mistakes to occur more readily. Over and over, small uncorrected errors are passed from the parent cell to the daughter cells and amplified as each generation produces more non-functional proteins from uncorrected DNA damage. Eventually, the pace of the cell cycle speeds up as the effectiveness of the control and repair mechanisms decreases. Uncontrolled growth of the mutated cells outpaces the growth of normal cells in the area, and a tumor (~<em>oma</em>) can result.</p> <h3>Proto-oncogenes</h3> <p>The genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called&nbsp;<strong>proto-oncogenes</strong>. Proto-oncogenes are normal genes that, when mutated in certain ways, become <strong>oncogenes</strong>, genes that cause a cell to become cancerous. Consider what might happen to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene. In most instances, the alteration of the DNA sequence will result in a less functional (or non-functional) protein. The result is detrimental to the cell and will likely prevent the cell from completing the cell cycle; however, the organism is not harmed because the mutation will not be carried forward. If a cell cannot reproduce, the mutation is not propagated and the damage is minimal. Occasionally, however, a gene mutation causes a change that increases the activity of a positive regulator. For example, a mutation that allows Cdk to be activated without being partnered with cyclin could push the cell cycle past a checkpoint before all of the required conditions are met. If the resulting daughter cells are too damaged to undergo further cell divisions, the mutation would not be propagated and no harm would come to the organism. However, if the atypical daughter cells are able to undergo further cell divisions, subsequent generations of cells will probably accumulate even more mutations, some possibly in additional genes that regulate the cell cycle.</p> <p>The Cdk gene in the above example is only one of many genes that are considered proto-oncogenes. In addition to the cell cycle regulatory proteins, any protein that influences the cycle can be altered in such a way as to override cell cycle checkpoints. An oncogene is any gene that, when altered, leads to an increase in the rate of cell cycle progression.</p> <h3>Tumor Suppressor Genes</h3> <p>Like proto-oncogenes, many of the negative cell cycle regulatory proteins were discovered in cells that had become cancerous.&nbsp;<strong>Tumor suppressor genes</strong> are segments of DNA that code for negative regulator proteins, the type of regulators that, when activated, can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division. The collective function of the best-understood tumor suppressor gene proteins, Rb, p53, and p21, is to put up a roadblock to cell cycle progression until certain events are completed. A cell that carries a mutated form of a negative regulator might not be able to halt the cell cycle if there is a problem. Tumor suppressors are similar to brakes in a vehicle: malfunctioning brakes can contribute to a car crash.</p> <p>Mutated p53 genes have been identified in more than one-half of all human tumor cells. This discovery is not surprising in light of the multiple roles that the p53 protein plays at the G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint. A cell with a faulty p53 may fail to detect errors present in the genomic DNA (Figure 5). Even if a partially functional p53 does identify the mutations, it may no longer be able to signal the necessary DNA repair enzymes. Either way, damaged DNA will remain uncorrected. At this point, a functional p53 will deem the cell unsalvageable and trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis). The damaged version of p53 found in cancer cells, however, cannot trigger apoptosis.</p> <div id="attachment_1812" style="width: 735px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1812" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03211301/Figure_10_04_011.png" alt="Part a: This illustration shows cell cycle regulation by normal p53, which arrests the cell cycle in response to DNA damage, cell cycle abnormalities, or hypoxia.

Without adequate levels of p21, there is no effective block on Cdk activation. Essentially, without a fully functional p53, the G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint is severely compromised and the cell proceeds directly from G<sub>1</sub> to S regardless of internal and external conditions. At the completion of this shortened cell cycle, two daughter cells are produced that have inherited the mutated p53 gene. Given the non-optimal conditions under which the parent cell reproduced, it is likely that the daughter cells will have acquired other mutations in addition to the faulty tumor suppressor gene. Cells such as these daughter cells quickly accumulate both oncogenes and non-functional tumor suppressor genes. Again, the result is tumor growth.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p>This video reviews the ways that cancer is a by-product of broken DNA replication:</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RZhL7LDPk8w/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &quot;Cancer | Cells | MCAT | Khan Academy&quot;" title="Cancer | Cells | MCAT | Khan Academy" /> <p>A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

There are three major checkpoints in the cell cycle: one near the end of G<sub>1</sub>, a second at the G<sub>2</sub>/M transition, and the third during metaphase. Positive regulator molecules allow the cell cycle to advance to the next stage. Negative regulator molecules monitor cellular conditions and can halt the cycle until specific requirements are met.</p> <p>Cancer is the result of unchecked cell division caused by a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate the cell cycle. The loss of control begins with a change in the DNA sequence of a gene that codes for one of the regulatory molecules. Faulty instructions lead to a protein that does not function as it should. Any disruption of the monitoring system can allow other mistakes to be passed on to the daughter cells. Each successive cell division will give rise to daughter cells with even more accumulated damage. Eventually, all checkpoints become nonfunctional, and rapidly reproducing cells crowd out normal cells, resulting in a tumor or leukemia (blood cancer).</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

In mitosis, both the parent and the daughter nuclei are at the same ploidy level—diploid for most plants and animals. While&nbsp;many unicellular organisms and a few multicellular organisms can produce genetically identical clones of themselves through mitosis, many single-celled organisms and most multicellular organisms reproduce regularly using another method: <strong>meiosis</strong>. Sexual reproduction, specifically meiosis and fertilization, introduces variation into offspring that may account for the evolutionary success of sexual reproduction. The vast majority of eukaryotic organisms, both multicellular and unicellular, can or must employ some form of meiosis and fertilization to reproduce.</p> <p>Meiosis employs many of the same mechanisms as mitosis. However, the starting nucleus is always diploid and the nuclei that result at the end of a meiotic cell division are haploid. To achieve this reduction in chromosome number, meiosis consists of one round of chromosome duplication and two rounds of nuclear division.</p> <p>Because the events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis, the same stage names are assigned. However, because there are two rounds of division, the major process and the stages are designated with a “I” or a “II.” Thus, <strong>meiosis I</strong> is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase I, prometaphase I, and so on. <strong>Meiosis II</strong>, in which the second round of meiotic division takes place, includes prophase II, prometaphase II, and so on.</p> <h2>Meiosis I</h2> <p>Meiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of the G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub> phases, which are nearly identical to the phases preceding mitosis. The G<sub>1</sub> phase, which is also called the first gap phase, is the first phase of the interphase and is focused on cell growth. The S phase is the second phase of interphase, during which the DNA of the chromosomes is replicated. Finally, the G<sub>2</sub> phase, also called the second gap phase, is the third and final phase of interphase; in this phase, the cell undergoes the final preparations for meiosis.</p> <p>During DNA duplication in the S phase, each chromosome is replicated to produce two identical copies, called sister chromatids, that are held together at the centromere by&nbsp;<strong>cohesin</strong> proteins. Cohesin holds the chromatids together until anaphase II. The centrosomes, which are the structures that organize the microtubules of the meiotic spindle, also replicate. This prepares the cell to enter prophase I, the first meiotic phase.</p> <h3>Prophase I</h3> <p>Early in prophase I, before the chromosomes can be seen clearly microscopically, the homologous chromosomes are attached at their tips to the nuclear envelope by proteins. As the nuclear envelope begins to break down, the proteins associated with homologous chromosomes bring the pair close to each other. (Recall that, in mitosis, homologous chromosomes do not pair together. In mitosis, homologous chromosomes line up end-to-end so that when they divide, each daughter cell receives a sister chromatid from both members of the homologous pair.) The&nbsp;<strong>synaptonemal complex</strong>, a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes, first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes. The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called <strong>synapsis</strong>. In synapsis, the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other. The synaptonemal complex supports the exchange of chromosomal segments between non-sister homologous chromatids, a process called crossing over. Crossing over can be observed visually after the exchange as <strong>chiasmata</strong> (singular = <em>chiasma</em>) (Figure 2).</p> <div id="attachment_1815" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1815" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03211613/Figure_11_01_011.jpg" alt="This illustration depicts two pairs of sister chromatids joined together to form homologous chromosomes.

Early in prophase I, homologous chromosomes come together to form a synapse. The chromosomes are bound tightly together and in perfect alignment by a protein lattice called a synaptonemal complex and by cohesin proteins at the centromere.</p> </div> <p>In species such as humans, even though the X and Y sex chromosomes are not homologous (most of their genes differ), they have a small region of homology that allows the X and Y chromosomes to pair up during prophase I. A partial synaptonemal complex develops only between the regions of homology.</p> <p>Located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called&nbsp;<strong>recombination nodules</strong>. These assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of <strong>crossover</strong>—or genetic recombination—between the non-sister chromatids. Near the recombination nodule on each chromatid, the double-stranded DNA is cleaved, the cut ends are modified, and a new connection is made between the non-sister chromatids. As prophase I progresses, the synaptonemal complex begins to break down and the chromosomes begin to condense. When the synaptonemal complex is gone, the homologous chromosomes remain attached to each other at the centromere and at chiasmata. The chiasmata remain until anaphase I. The number of chiasmata varies according to the species and the length of the chromosome. There must be at least one chiasma per chromosome for proper separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, but there may be as many as 25. Following crossover, the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin connection between homologous pairs is also removed. At the end of prophase I, the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata (Figure 3) and are called <strong>tetrads</strong> because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible.</p> <div id="attachment_1816" style="width: 741px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1816" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03211711/Figure_11_01_021-731x1024.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a pair of homologous chromosomes that are aligned.

Crossover occurs between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. The result is an exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes.</p> </div> <p>The crossover events are the first source of genetic variation in the nuclei produced by meiosis. A single crossover event between homologous non-sister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent DNA between a maternal chromosome and a paternal chromosome. Now, when that sister chromatid is moved into a gamete cell it will carry some DNA from one parent of the individual and some DNA from the other parent. The sister recombinant chromatid has a combination of maternal and paternal genes that did not exist before the crossover. Multiple crossovers in an arm of the chromosome have the same effect, exchanging segments of DNA to create recombinant chromosomes.</p> <h3>Prometaphase I</h3> <p>The key event in prometaphase I is the attachment of the spindle fiber microtubules to the kinetochore proteins at the centromeres. Kinetochore proteins are multiprotein complexes that bind the centromeres of a chromosome to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Microtubules grow from centrosomes placed at opposite poles of the cell. The microtubules move toward the middle of the cell and attach to one of the two fused homologous chromosomes. The microtubules attach at each chromosomes’ kinetochores. With each member of the homologous pair attached to opposite poles of the cell, in the next phase, the microtubules can pull the homologous pair apart. A spindle fiber that has attached to a kinetochore is called a kinetochore microtubule. At the end of prometaphase I, each tetrad is attached to microtubules from both poles, with one homologous chromosome facing each pole. The homologous chromosomes are still held together at chiasmata. In addition, the nuclear membrane has broken down entirely.</p> <h3>Metaphase I</h3> <p>During metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are arranged in the center of the cell with the kinetochores facing opposite poles. The homologous pairs orient themselves randomly at the equator. For example, if the two homologous members of chromosome 1 are labeled a and b, then the chromosomes could line up a-b, or b-a. This is important in determining the genes carried by a gamete, as each will only receive one of the two homologous chromosomes. Recall that homologous chromosomes are not identical. They contain slight differences in their genetic information, causing each gamete to have a unique genetic makeup.</p> <p>This randomness is the physical basis for the creation of the second form of genetic variation in offspring. Consider that the homologous chromosomes of a sexually reproducing organism are originally inherited as two separate sets, one from each parent. Using humans as an example, one set of 23 chromosomes is present in the egg donated by the mother. The father provides the other set of 23 chromosomes in the sperm that fertilizes the egg. Every cell of the multicellular offspring has copies of the original two sets of homologous chromosomes. In prophase I of meiosis, the homologous chromosomes form the tetrads. In metaphase I, these pairs line up at the midway point between the two poles of the cell to form the metaphase plate. Because there is an equal chance that a microtubule fiber will encounter a maternally or paternally inherited chromosome, the arrangement of the tetrads at the metaphase plate is random. Any maternally inherited chromosome may face either pole. Any paternally inherited chromosome may also face either pole. The orientation of each tetrad is independent of the orientation of the other 22 tetrads.</p> <p>This event—the random (or independent) assortment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate—is the second mechanism that introduces variation into the gametes or spores. In each cell that undergoes meiosis, the arrangement of the tetrads is different. The number of variations is dependent on the number of chromosomes making up a set. There are two possibilities for orientation at the metaphase plate; the possible number of alignments therefore equals 2<em><sup>n</sup>,</em> where <em>n</em> is the number of chromosomes per set. Humans have 23 chromosome pairs, which results in over eight million (2<sup>23</sup>) possible genetically-distinct gametes. This number does not include the variability that was previously created in the sister chromatids by crossover. Given these two mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that any two haploid cells resulting from meiosis will have the same genetic composition (Figure 4).</p> <div id="attachment_1817" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1817" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03211855/Figure_11_01_03-1024x904.jpg" alt="This illustration shows that, in a cell with a set of two chromosomes, four possible arrangements of chromosomes can give rise to eight different kinds of gamete.

The process of chromosome alignment differs between meiosis I and meiosis II. In prometaphase I, microtubules attach to the fused kinetochores of homologous chromosomes, and the homologous chromosomes are arranged at the midpoint of the cell in metaphase I. In anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are separated. In prometaphase II, microtubules attach to the kinetochores of sister chromatids, and the sister chromatids are arranged at the midpoint of the cells in metaphase II. In anaphase II, the sister chromatids are separated.</p> </div> <h3>Telophase I and Cytokinesis</h3> <p>In telophase, the separated chromosomes arrive at opposite poles. The remainder of the typical telophase events may or may not occur, depending on the species. In some organisms, the chromosomes decondense and nuclear envelopes form around the chromatids in telophase I. In other organisms, cytokinesis—the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells—occurs without reformation of the nuclei. In nearly all species of animals and some fungi, cytokinesis separates the cell contents via a cleavage furrow (constriction of the actin ring that leads to cytoplasmic division). In plants, a cell plate is formed during cell cytokinesis by Golgi vesicles fusing at the metaphase plate. This cell plate will ultimately lead to the formation of cell walls that separate the two daughter cells.</p> <p>Two haploid cells are the end result of the first meiotic division. The cells are haploid because at each pole, there is just one of each pair of the homologous chromosomes. Therefore, only one full set of the chromosomes is present. This is why the cells are considered haploid—there is only one chromosome set, even though each homolog still consists of two sister chromatids. Recall that sister chromatids are merely duplicates of one of the two homologous chromosomes (except for changes that occurred during crossing over). In meiosis II, these two sister chromatids will separate, creating four haploid daughter cells.</p> <h2>Meiosis II</h2> <p>In some species, cells enter a brief interphase, or&nbsp;<strong>interkinesis</strong>, before entering meiosis II. Interkinesis lacks an S phase, so chromosomes are not duplicated. The two cells produced in meiosis I go through the events of meiosis II in synchrony. During meiosis II, the sister chromatids within the two daughter cells separate, forming four new haploid gametes. The mechanics of meiosis II is similar to mitosis, except that each dividing cell has only one set of homologous chromosomes. Therefore, each cell has half the number of sister chromatids to separate out as a diploid cell undergoing mitosis.</p> <h3>Prophase II</h3> <p>If the chromosomes decondensed in telophase I, they condense again. If nuclear envelopes were formed, they fragment into vesicles. The centrosomes that were duplicated during interkinesis move away from each other toward opposite poles, and new spindles are formed.</p> <h3>Prometaphase II</h3> <p>The nuclear envelopes are completely broken down, and the spindle is fully formed. Each sister chromatid forms an individual kinetochore that attaches to microtubules from opposite poles.</p> <h3>Metaphase II</h3> <p>The sister chromatids are maximally condensed and aligned at the equator of the cell.</p> <h3>Anaphase II</h3> <p>The sister chromatids are pulled apart by the kinetochore microtubules and move toward opposite poles. Non-kinetochore microtubules elongate the cell.</p> <div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1818" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03212035/Figure_11_01_041-1024x822.jpg" alt="This illustration compares chromosome alignment in meiosis I and meiosis II.

It appears to have been very successful because most eukaryotes are able to reproduce sexually, and in many animals, it is the only mode of reproduction. And yet, scientists recognize some real disadvantages to sexual reproduction. On the surface, creating offspring that are genetic clones of the parent appears to be a better system. If the parent organism is successfully occupying a habitat, offspring with the same traits would be similarly successful. There is also the obvious benefit to an organism that can produce offspring whenever circumstances are favorable by asexual budding, fragmentation, or asexual eggs. These methods of reproduction do not require another organism of the opposite sex. Indeed, some organisms that lead a solitary lifestyle have retained the ability to reproduce asexually. In addition, in asexual populations, every individual is capable of reproduction. In sexual populations, the males are not producing the offspring themselves, so in theory an asexual population could grow twice as fast.</p> <p>However, multicellular organisms that exclusively depend on asexual reproduction are exceedingly rare. Why is sexuality (and meiosis) so common? This is one of the important unanswered questions in biology and has been the focus of much research beginning in the latter half of the twentieth century. There are several possible explanations, one of which is that the variation that sexual reproduction creates among offspring is very important to the survival and reproduction of the population. Thus, on average, a sexually reproducing population will leave more descendants than an otherwise similar asexually reproducing population. The only source of variation in asexual organisms is mutation. This is the ultimate source of variation in sexual organisms, but in addition, those different mutations are continually reshuffled from one generation to the next when different parents combine their unique genomes and the genes are mixed into different combinations by crossovers during prophase I and random assortment at metaphase I.</p> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>The Red Queen Hypothesis</h3> <p>It is not in dispute that sexual reproduction provides evolutionary advantages to organisms that employ this mechanism to produce offspring. But why, even in the face of fairly stable conditions, does sexual reproduction persist when it is more difficult and costly for individual organisms? Variation is the outcome of sexual reproduction, but why are ongoing variations necessary? Enter the Red Queen hypothesis, first proposed by Leigh Van Valen in 1973. The concept was named in reference to the Red Queen’s race in Lewis Carroll’s book,&nbsp;<em>Through the Looking-Glass</em>.</p> <p>All species co-evolve with other organisms; for example predators evolve with their prey, and parasites evolve with their hosts. Each tiny advantage gained by favorable variation gives a species an edge over close competitors, predators, parasites, or even prey. The only method that will allow a co-evolving species to maintain its own share of the resources is to also continually improve its fitness. As one species gains an advantage, this increases selection on the other species; they must also develop an advantage or they will be outcompeted. No single species progresses too far ahead because genetic variation among the progeny of sexual reproduction provides all species with a mechanism to improve rapidly. Species that cannot keep up become extinct. The Red Queen’s catchphrase was, “It takes all the running you can do to stay in the same place.” This is an apt description of co-evolution between competing species.</p> </div> <h3>Life Cycles of Sexually Reproducing Organisms</h3> <p>Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual&nbsp;<strong>life cycles</strong>. What happens between these two events depends on the organism. The process of meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half. Fertilization, the joining of two haploid gametes, restores the diploid condition. There are three main categories of life cycles in multicellular organisms: <strong>diploid-dominant</strong>, in which the multicellular diploid stage is the most obvious life stage, such as with most animals including humans; <strong>haploid-dominant</strong>, in which the multicellular haploid stage is the most obvious life stage, such as with all fungi and some algae; and <strong>alternation of generations</strong>, in which the two stages are apparent to different degrees depending on the group, as with plants and some algae.</p> <h4>Diploid-Dominant Life Cycle</h4> <p>Nearly all animals employ a diploid-dominant life-cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism are the gametes. Early in the development of the embryo, specialized diploid cells, called&nbsp;<strong>germ cells</strong>, are produced within the gonads, such as the testes and ovaries. Germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the cell line and meiosis to produce gametes. Once the haploid gametes are formed, they lose the ability to divide again. There is no multicellular haploid life stage. Fertilization occurs with the fusion of two gametes, usually from different individuals, restoring the diploid state (Figure 1).</p> <div id="attachment_1823" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1823" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03212950/Figure_11_02_011-1024x687.jpg" alt="This illustration shows the life cycle of animals.

The haploid cells that make up the tissues of the dominant multicellular stage are formed by mitosis. During sexual reproduction, specialized haploid cells from two individuals, designated the (+) and (−) mating types, join to form a diploid zygote. The zygote immediately undergoes meiosis to form four haploid cells called spores. Although haploid like the “parents,” these spores contain a new genetic combination from two parents. The spores can remain dormant for various time periods. Eventually, when conditions are conducive, the spores form multicellular haploid structures by many rounds of mitosis (Example&nbsp;1).</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <div id="attachment_1824" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1824" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03213033/Figure_11_02_021-1024x707.jpg" alt="This illustration shows the life cycle of fungi.

Plants have a life cycle that alternates between a multicellular haploid organism and a multicellular diploid organism. In some plants, such as ferns, both the haploid and diploid plant stages are free-living. The diploid plant is called a sporophyte because it produces haploid spores by meiosis. The spores develop into multicellular, haploid plants called gametophytes because they produce gametes. The gametes of two individuals will fuse to form a diploid zygote that becomes the sporophyte. (credit “fern”: modification of work by Cory Zanker; credit “sporangia”: modification of work by “Obsidian Soul”/Wikimedia Commons; credit “gametophyte and sporophyte”: modification of work by “Vlmastra”/Wikimedia Commons)</p> </div> <p>Although all plants utilize some version of the alternation of generations, the relative size of the sporophyte and the gametophyte and the relationship between them vary greatly. In plants such as moss, the gametophyte organism is the free-living plant, and the sporophyte is physically dependent on the gametophyte. In other plants, such as ferns, both the gametophyte and sporophyte plants are free-living; however, the sporophyte is much larger. In seed plants, such as magnolia trees and daisies, the gametophyte is composed of only a few cells and, in the case of the female gametophyte, is completely retained within the sporophyte.</p> <p>Sexual reproduction takes many forms in multicellular organisms. However, at some point in each type of life cycle, meiosis produces haploid cells that will fuse with the haploid cell of another organism. The mechanisms of variation—crossover, random assortment of homologous chromosomes, and random fertilization—are present in all versions of sexual reproduction. The fact that nearly every multicellular organism on Earth employs sexual reproduction is strong evidence for the benefits of producing offspring with unique gene combinations, though there are other possible benefits as well.</p> <h2>Genetic Variation in Meiosis</h2> <p>The gametes produced in meiosis aren’t genetically identical to the starting cell, and they also aren’t identical to one another. As an example, consider the meiosis II diagram above, which shows the end products of meiosis for a simple cell with a diploid number of <strong>2<em>n</em> = 4</strong> chromosomes. The four gametes produced at the end of meiosis II are all slightly different, each with a unique combination of the genetic material present in the starting cell.</p> <p>As it turns out, there are many more potential gamete types than just the four shown in the diagram, even for a simple cell with with only four chromosomes. This diversity of possible gametes reflects two factors: crossing over and the random orientation of homologue pairs during metaphase of meiosis I.</p> <ul><li><strong>Crossing over.</strong> The points where homologues cross over and exchange genetic material are chosen more or less at random, and they will be different in each cell that goes through meiosis. If meiosis happens many times, as it does in human ovaries and testes, crossovers will happen at many different points. This repetition produces a wide variety of recombinant chromosomes, chromosomes where fragments of DNA have been exchanged between homologues.</li> <li><strong>Random orientation of homologue pairs.</strong> The random orientation of homologue pairs during metaphase of meiosis I is another important source of gamete diversity.</li> </ul> <div id="attachment_2497" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-2497" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02160935/random_orientation-755x1024.png" alt="Diagram showing the relationship between chromosome configuration at meiosis I and homologue segregation to gametes.

Chromosome configuration and homologue segregation</p> </div> <p>What exactly does <em>random orientation</em> mean here? Well, a homologous pair consists of one homologue from your dad and one from your mom, and you have 23&nbsp;pairs of homologous chromosomes all together, counting the X and Y as homologous for this purpose. During meiosis I, the homologous pairs will separate to form two equal groups, but it’s not usually the case that all the paternal—dad—chromosomes will go into one group and all the maternal—mom—chromosomes into the other.</p> <p>Instead, each pair of homologues will effectively flip a coin to decide which chromosome goes into which group. In a cell with just two pairs of homologous chromosomes, like the one at right, random metaphase orientation allows for 2<sup>2</sup> = 4&nbsp;different types of possible gametes. In a human cell, the same mechanism allows for 2<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;= 8,388,608 different types of possible gametes<span class="footnote">Reece, J. B., L. A. Urry, M. L. Cain, S. A. Wasserman, P. V.

And that’s not even considering crossovers!</p> <p>Given those kinds of numbers, it’s very unlikely that any two sperm or egg cells made by a person will be the same. It’s even more unlikely that you and your sister or brother will be genetically identical, unless you happen to be identical twins, thanks to the process of fertilization (in which a unique egg from Mom combines with a unique sperm from Dad, making a zygote whose genotype is well beyond one-in-a-trillion!)<span class="footnote">Ibid.</span>.</p> <p>Meiosis and fertilization create genetic variation by making new combinations of gene variants (alleles). In some cases, these new combinations may make an organism more or less fit (able to survive and reproduce), thus providing the raw material for natural selection. Genetic variation is important in allowing a population to adapt via natural selection and thus survive in the long term.</p> <h2>Chromosomal Structural Rearrangements</h2> <p>Cytologists have characterized numerous structural rearrangements in chromosomes, but chromosome inversions and translocations are the most common. Both are identified during meiosis by the adaptive pairing of rearranged chromosomes with their former homologs to maintain appropriate gene alignment. If the genes carried on two homologs are not oriented correctly, a recombination event could result in the loss of genes from one chromosome and the gain of genes on the other. This would produce aneuploid gametes.</p> <h3>Chromosome Inversions</h3> <p>A&nbsp;<strong>chromosome inversion</strong> is the detachment, 180° rotation, and reinsertion of part of a chromosome. Inversions may occur in nature as a result of mechanical shear, or from the action of transposable elements (special DNA sequences capable of facilitating the rearrangement of chromosome segments with the help of enzymes that cut and paste DNA sequences). Unless they disrupt a gene sequence, inversions only change the orientation of genes and are likely to have more mild effects than aneuploid errors. However, altered gene orientation can result in functional changes because regulators of gene expression could be moved out of position with respect to their targets, causing aberrant levels of gene products.</p> <p>An inversion can be&nbsp;<strong>pericentric</strong> and include the centromere, or <strong>paracentric</strong> and occur outside of the centromere (Figure 5). A pericentric inversion that is asymmetric about the centromere can change the relative lengths of the chromosome arms, making these inversions easily identifiable.</p> <div id="attachment_1701" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1701" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03155434/Figure_13_03_071.jpg" alt="Illustration shows pericentric and paracentric inversions.

In rare instances, such a change can result in the evolution of a new species. In fact, a pericentric inversion in chromosome 18 appears to have contributed to the evolution of humans. This inversion is not present in our closest genetic relatives, the chimpanzees. Humans and chimpanzees differ cytogenetically by pericentric inversions on several chromosomes and by the fusion of two separate chromosomes in chimpanzees that correspond to chromosome two in humans.</p> <p>The pericentric chromosome 18 inversion is believed to have occurred in early humans following their divergence from a common ancestor with chimpanzees approximately five million years ago. Researchers characterizing this inversion have suggested that approximately 19,000 nucleotide bases were duplicated on 18p, and the duplicated region inverted and reinserted on chromosome 18 of an ancestral human.</p> <p>A comparison of human and chimpanzee genes in the region of this inversion indicates that two genes—<em>ROCK1</em> and <em>USP14</em>—that are adjacent on chimpanzee chromosome 17 (which corresponds to human chromosome 18) are more distantly positioned on human chromosome 18. This suggests that one of the inversion breakpoints occurred between these two genes. Interestingly, humans and chimpanzees express <em>USP14</em> at distinct levels in specific cell types, including cortical cells and fibroblasts. Perhaps the chromosome 18 inversion in an ancestral human repositioned specific genes and reset their expression levels in a useful way. Because both <em>ROCK1</em> and <em>USP14</em> encode cellular enzymes, a change in their expression could alter cellular function. It is not known how this inversion contributed to hominid evolution, but it appears to be a significant factor in the divergence of humans from other primates.</p> </div> <h3>Translocations</h3> <p>A&nbsp;<strong>translocation</strong> occurs when a segment of a chromosome dissociates and reattaches to a different, nonhomologous chromosome. Translocations can be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions of genes are altered with respect to regulatory sequences. Notably, specific translocations have been associated with several cancers and with schizophrenia. Reciprocal translocations result from the exchange of chromosome segments between two nonhomologous chromosomes such that there is no gain or loss of genetic information (Figure 7).</p> <div id="attachment_1703" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1703" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/03155706/Figure_13_03_09.jpg" alt="Illustration shows a reciprocal translocation in which DNA is transferred from one chromosome to another.

This karyotype is of a female human. Notice that homologous chromosomes are the same size, and have the same centromere positions and banding patterns. A human male would have an XY chromosome pair instead of the XX pair shown. (credit: Andreas Blozer et al)</p> </div> <p>In a given species, chromosomes can be identified by their number, size, centromere position, and banding pattern. In a human karyotype,&nbsp;<strong>autosomes</strong> or “body chromosomes” (all of the non–sex chromosomes) are generally organized in approximate order of size from largest (chromosome 1) to smallest (chromosome 22). The X and Y chromosomes are not autosomes. However, chromosome 21 is actually shorter than chromosome 22. This was discovered after the naming of Down syndrome as trisomy 21, reflecting how this disease results from possessing one extra chromosome 21 (three total). Not wanting to change the name of this important disease, chromosome 21 retained its numbering, despite describing the shortest set of chromosomes. The chromosome “arms” projecting from either end of the centromere may be designated as short or long, depending on their relative lengths. The short arm is abbreviated&nbsp;<em>p </em>(for “petite”), whereas the long arm is abbreviated <em>q </em>(because it follows “p” alphabetically). Each arm is further subdivided and denoted by a number. Using this naming system, locations on chromosomes can be described consistently in the scientific literature.</p> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>Geneticists Use Karyograms to Identify Chromosomal Aberrations</h3> <p>Although Mendel is referred to as the “father of modern genetics,” he performed his experiments with none of the tools that the geneticists of today routinely employ. One such powerful cytological technique is karyotyping, a method in which traits characterized by chromosomal abnormalities can be identified from a single cell. To observe an individual’s karyotype, a person’s cells (like white blood cells) are first collected from a blood sample or other tissue. In the laboratory, the isolated cells are stimulated to begin actively dividing. A chemical called colchicine is then applied to cells to arrest condensed chromosomes in metaphase. Cells are then made to swell using a hypotonic solution so the chromosomes spread apart. Finally, the sample is preserved in a fixative and applied to a slide.</p> <p>The geneticist then stains chromosomes with one of several dyes to better visualize the distinct and reproducible banding patterns of each chromosome pair. Following staining, the chromosomes are viewed using bright-field microscopy. A common stain choice is the Giemsa stain. Giemsa staining results in approximately 400–800 bands (of tightly coiled DNA and condensed proteins) arranged along all of the 23 chromosome pairs; an experienced geneticist can identify each band. In addition to the banding patterns, chromosomes are further identified on the basis of size and centromere location. To obtain the classic depiction of the karyotype in which homologous pairs of chromosomes are aligned in numerical order from longest to shortest, the geneticist obtains a digital image, identifies each chromosome, and manually arranges the chromosomes into this pattern (Figure&nbsp;1).</p> <p>At its most basic, the karyogram may reveal genetic abnormalities in which an individual has too many or too few chromosomes per cell. Examples of this are Down Syndrome, which is identified by a third copy of chromosome 21, and Turner Syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of only one X chromosome in women instead of the normal two. Geneticists can also identify large deletions or insertions of DNA. For instance, Jacobsen Syndrome—which involves distinctive facial features as well as heart and bleeding defects—is identified by a deletion on chromosome 11. Finally, the karyotype can pinpoint translocations, which occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome and reattaches to another chromosome.&nbsp;Translocations are implicated in certain cancers, including chronic myelogenous leukemia.</p> <p>During Mendel’s lifetime, inheritance was an abstract concept that could only be inferred by performing crosses and observing the traits expressed by offspring. By observing a karyogram, today’s geneticists can actually visualize the chromosomal composition of an individual to confirm or predict genetic abnormalities in offspring, even before birth.</p> </div> <h2>Common Disorders</h2> <p>Of all of the chromosomal disorders, abnormalities in chromosome&nbsp;number are the most obviously identifiable from a karyogram. Disorders of chromosome&nbsp;number include the duplication or loss of entire chromosomes, as well as changes in the number of complete sets of chromosomes. They are caused by nondisjunction, which occurs when pairs of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis. Misaligned or incomplete synapsis, or a dysfunction of the spindle apparatus that facilitates chromosome&nbsp;migration, can cause nondisjunction. The risk of nondisjunction occurring increases with the age of the parents.</p> <p>Nondisjunction can occur during either meiosis I or II, with differing results (Figure&nbsp;1). If homologous chromosomes fail to separate during meiosis I, the result is two gametes that lack that particular chromosome&nbsp;and two gametes with two copies of the chromosome. If sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis II, the result is one gamete that lacks that chromosome, two normal gametes with one copy of the chromosome, and one gamete with two copies of the chromosome.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <div id="attachment_1525" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1525" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02203345/Figure_13_03_02.jpg" alt="This illustration shows nondisjunction that occurs during meiosis I.

The incidence of having a fetus with trisomy 21 increases dramatically with maternal age.</p> </div> <p>An individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called&nbsp;<strong>euploid</strong>; in humans, euploidy corresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. An individual with an error in chromosome&nbsp;number is described as <strong>aneuploid</strong>, a term that includes <strong>monosomy</strong> (loss of one chromosome) or <strong>trisomy</strong> (gain of an extraneous chromosome). Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they lack essential genes. This underscores the importance of “gene dosage” in humans. Most autosomal trisomies also fail to develop to birth; however, duplications of some of the smaller chromosomes (13, 15, 18, 21, or 22) can result in offspring that survive for several weeks to many years. Trisomic individuals suffer from a different type of genetic imbalance: an excess in gene dose. Individuals with an extra chromosome&nbsp;may synthesize an abundance of the gene products encoded by that chromosome. This extra dose (150 percent) of specific genes can lead to a number of functional challenges and often precludes development. The most common trisomy among viable births is that of chromosome&nbsp;21, which corresponds to Down Syndrome. Individuals with this inherited disorder are characterized by short stature and stunted digits, facial distinctions that include a broad skull and large tongue, and significant developmental delays. The incidence of Down syndrome is correlated with maternal age; older women are more likely to become pregnant with fetuses carrying the trisomy 21 genotype (Figure&nbsp;2).</p> <h3>Polyploidy</h3> <div id="attachment_1527" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1527" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02203701/Figure_13_03_04.jpg" alt="Photo shows an orange daylily" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02203701/Figure_13_03_04.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02203701/Figure_13_03_04-300x225.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02203701/Figure_13_03_04-65x49.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02203701/Figure_13_03_04-225x169.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02203701/Figure_13_03_04-350x263.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure&nbsp;3. As with many polyploid plants, this triploid orange daylily (<em>Hemerocallis fulva</em>) is particularly large and robust, and grows flowers with triple the number of petals of its diploid counterparts. (credit: Steve Karg)</p> </div> <p>An individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets (two for diploid species) is called <strong>polyploid</strong>. For instance, fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote. Polyploid animals are extremely rare, with only a few examples among the flatworms, crustaceans, amphibians, fish, and lizards. Polyploid animals are sterile because meiosis cannot proceed normally and instead produces mostly aneuploid daughter cells that cannot yield viable zygotes. Rarely, polyploid animals can reproduce asexually by haplodiploidy, in which an unfertilized egg divides mitotically to produce offspring. In contrast, polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom, and polyploid plants tend to be larger and more robust than euploids of their species (Figure&nbsp;3).</p> <h3>Sex Chromosome Nondisjunction in Humans</h3> <p>Humans display dramatic deleterious effects with autosomal trisomies and monosomies. Therefore, it may seem counterintuitive that human females and males can function normally, despite carrying different numbers of the X&nbsp;chromosome. Rather than a gain or loss of autosomes, variations in the number of sex chromosomes are associated with relatively mild effects. In part, this occurs because of a molecular process called <strong>X inactivation</strong>. Early in development, when female mammalian embryos consist of just a few thousand cells (relative to trillions in the newborn), one X&nbsp;chromosome in each cell inactivates by tightly condensing into a quiescent (dormant) structure called a Barr body. The chance that an X&nbsp;chromosome (maternally or paternally derived) is inactivated in each cell is random, but once the inactivation occurs, all cells derived from that one will have the same inactive X&nbsp;chromosome or Barr body. By this process, females compensate for their double genetic dose of X&nbsp;chromosome.</p> <div id="attachment_1528" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1528" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02203751/Figure_13_03_05.jpg" alt="Photo shows a tortoiseshell cat with orange and black fur." width="400" height="445" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02203751/Figure_13_03_05.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02203751/Figure_13_03_05-270x300.jpg 270w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02203751/Figure_13_03_05-65x72.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02203751/Figure_13_03_05-225x250.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02203751/Figure_13_03_05-350x389.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure&nbsp;4. In cats, the gene for coat color is located on the X&nbsp;chromosome. In the embryonic development of female cats, one of the two X&nbsp;chromosomes is randomly inactivated in each cell, resulting in a tortoiseshell pattern if the cat has two different alleles for coat color. Male cats, having only one X&nbsp;chromosome, never exhibit a tortoiseshell coat color. (credit: Michael Bodega)</p> </div> <p>In so-called “tortoiseshell” cats, embryonic X inactivation is observed as color variegation (Figure&nbsp;4). Females that are heterozygous for an X-linked coat color gene will express one of two different coat colors over different regions of their body, corresponding to whichever X&nbsp;chromosome is inactivated in the embryonic cell progenitor of that region.</p> <p>An individual carrying an abnormal number of X&nbsp;chromosomes will inactivate all but one X&nbsp;chromosome in each of her cells. However, even inactivated X&nbsp;chromosomes continue to express a few genes, and X&nbsp;chromosomes must reactivate for the proper maturation of female ovaries. As a result, X-chromosomal abnormalities are typically associated with mild mental and physical defects, as well as sterility. If the X&nbsp;chromosome is absent altogether, the individual will not develop in utero.</p> <p>Several errors in sex chromosome number have been characterized. Individuals with three X&nbsp;chromosomes, called triplo-X, are phenotypically female but express developmental delays and reduced fertility. The XXY genotype, corresponding to one type of Klinefelter syndrome, corresponds to phenotypically male individuals with small testes, enlarged breasts, and reduced body hair. More complex types of Klinefelter syndrome exist in which the individual has as many as five X&nbsp;chromosomes. In all types, every X&nbsp;chromosome except one undergoes inactivation to compensate for the excess genetic dosage. This can be seen as several Barr bodies in each cell nucleus. Turner syndrome, characterized as an X0 genotype (i.e., only a single sex chromosome), corresponds to a phenotypically female individual with short stature, webbed skin in the neck region, hearing and cardiac impairments, and sterility.</p> <h3>Duplications and Deletions</h3> <p>In addition to the loss or gain of an entire chromosome, a chromosomal segment may be duplicated or lost. Duplications and deletions often produce offspring that survive but exhibit physical and mental abnormalities. Duplicated chromosomal segments may fuse to existing chromosomes or may be free in the nucleus. Cri-du-chat (from the French for “cry of the cat”) is a syndrome associated with nervous system abnormalities and identifiable physical features that result from a deletion of most of 5p (the small arm of chromosome&nbsp;5) (Figure&nbsp;5). Infants with this genotype emit a characteristic high-pitched cry on which the disorder’s name is based.</p> <div id="attachment_1530" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1530" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02204756/Figure_13_03_06-1024x333.jpg" alt="Photos show a boy with cri-du-chat syndrome.

They share some similarities, but also exhibit distinct differences that lead to very different outcomes (Figure 1 and Table 1). Mitosis is a single nuclear division that results in two nuclei that are usually partitioned into two new cells. The nuclei resulting from a mitotic division are genetically identical to the original nucleus. They have the same number of sets of chromosomes, one set in the case of haploid cells and two sets in the case of diploid cells. In most plants and all animal species, it is typically diploid cells that undergo mitosis to form new diploid cells. In contrast, meiosis consists of two nuclear divisions resulting in four nuclei that are usually partitioned into four new cells. The nuclei resulting from meiosis are not genetically identical and they contain one chromosome set only. This is half the number of chromosome sets in the original cell, which is diploid.</p> <p id="fs-id1322104">The main differences between mitosis and meiosis occur in meiosis I, which is a very different nuclear division than mitosis. In meiosis I, the homologous chromosome pairs become associated with each other, are bound together with the synaptonemal complex, develop chiasmata and undergo crossover between sister chromatids, and line up along the metaphase plate in tetrads with kinetochore fibers from opposite spindle poles attached to each kinetochore of a homolog in a tetrad. All of these events occur only in meiosis I.</p> <div id="attachment_3932" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-3932" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/16222549/Figure_11_01_06-1024x586.jpg" alt="This illustration compares meiosis and mitosis.

Meiosis is such an extraordinarily complex series of cellular events that biologists have had trouble hypothesizing and testing how it may have evolved. Although meiosis is inextricably entwined with sexual reproduction and its advantages and disadvantages, it is important to separate the questions of the evolution of meiosis and the evolution of sex, because early meiosis may have been advantageous for different reasons than it is now. Thinking outside the box and imagining what the early benefits from meiosis might have been is one approach to uncovering how it may have evolved.</p> <p>Meiosis and mitosis share obvious cellular processes and it makes sense that meiosis evolved from mitosis. The difficulty lies in the clear differences between meiosis I and mitosis. Adam Wilkins and Robin Holliday<span class="footnote">Adam S. Wilkins and Robin Holliday, “The Evolution of Meiosis from Mitosis,” <em data-effect="italics">Genetics</em> 181 (2009): 3–12.</span> summarized the unique events that needed to occur for the evolution of meiosis from mitosis. These steps are homologous chromosome pairing, crossover exchanges, sister chromatids remaining attached during anaphase, and suppression of DNA replication in interphase. They argue that the first step is the hardest and most important, and that understanding how it evolved would make the evolutionary process clearer. They suggest genetic experiments that might shed light on the evolution of synapsis.</p> <p>There are other approaches to understanding the evolution of meiosis in progress. Different forms of meiosis exist in single-celled protists. Some appear to be simpler or more “primitive” forms of meiosis. Comparing the meiotic divisions of different protists may shed light on the evolution of meiosis. Marilee Ramesh and colleagues<span class="footnote">Marilee A. Ramesh, Shehre-Banoo Malik and John M. Logsdon, Jr, “A Phylogenetic Inventory of Meiotic Genes: Evidence for Sex in <em data-effect="italics">Giardia</em> and an Early Eukaryotic Origin of Meiosis,” <em data-effect="italics">Current Biology</em> 15 (2005):185–91.</span> compared the genes involved in meiosis in protists to understand when and where meiosis might have evolved. Although research is still ongoing, recent scholarship into meiosis in protists suggests that some aspects of meiosis may have evolved later than others. This kind of genetic comparison can tell us what aspects of meiosis are the oldest and what cellular processes they may have borrowed from in earlier cells.</p> </div> </div><div class="licensing"><div class="license-attribution-dropdown-subheading">CC licensed content, Shared previously</div><ul class="citation-list"><li>Biology. <strong>Provided by</strong>: OpenStax CNX. <strong>Located at</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="http://cnx.org/contents/185cbf87-c72e-48f5-b51e-f14f21b5eabd@10.8">http://cnx.org/contents/185cbf87-c72e-48f5-b51e-f14f21b5eabd@10.8</a>. <strong>License</strong>: <em><a target="_blank" rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY: Attribution</a></em>. <strong>License Terms</strong>: Download for free at http://cnx.org/contents/185cbf87-c72e-48f5-b51e-f14f21b5eabd@10.8</li></ul></div>

It’s not just your eyes, smile, and personality. Your health, risk for disease, and the ways you respond to medicines are also unique. Medicines that work well for some people may not help you at all. In fact, they might even cause problems. Wouldn’t it be nice if treatments and preventive care could be designed just for you?</p> <p>The careful matching of your biology to your medical care is known as personalized medicine. It’s already being used by health care providers nationwide.</p> <p><img class="alignright wp-image-4086" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/06001221/noun_783433_cc-e1483661565513.png" alt="an illustration of a strand of DNA" width="200" height="353" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/06001221/noun_783433_cc-e1483661565513.png 337w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/06001221/noun_783433_cc-e1483661565513-170x300.png 170w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/06001221/noun_783433_cc-e1483661565513-65x115.png 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/06001221/noun_783433_cc-e1483661565513-225x397.png 225w" />The story of personalized medicine begins with the unique DNA you inherited from your parents. DNA is responsible for all the physical traits that make you function as a human organism. It plays a vital role in life on this planet. DNA stores genetic information.</p> <p>Genes are stretches of DNA that serve as a sort of instruction manual telling your body how to make the proteins and perform the other tasks that your body needs. The same genes often differ slightly between people. Bases may be switched, missing, or added here and there. Most of these variations have no effect on your health. But some can create unusual proteins that might boost your risk for certain diseases. Some variants can affect how well a medicine works in your body. Or they might cause a medicine to have different side effects in you than in someone else.</p> <p>It’s becoming more common for doctors to test for gene variants before prescribing certain drugs. “If doctors know your genes, they can predict drug response and incorporate this information into the medical decisions they make,” says Dr. Rochelle Long, a pharmacogenomics expert at NIH. “By screening to know who shouldn’t get certain drugs, we can prevent life-threatening side effects,” Long says.</p> <p>Even one of the oldest and most common drugs, aspirin, can have varying effects based on your genes. Millions of people take a daily aspirin to lower their risk for heart attack and stroke. Aspirin helps by preventing blood clots that could clog arteries. But aspirin doesn’t reduce heart disease risk in everyone.</p> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>Personalized Medicine in Practice</h3> <p>Here are just a few treatments that benefit from personalization:</p> <ul><li>Blood clot treatments</li> <li>Colorectal cancer treatments</li> <li>Breast cancer treatments</li> </ul> </div> <p>So what does this mean for you? Is personalized medicine something you should look into?

Pyrimidines are smaller in size; they have a single six-membered ring structure. The carbon atoms of the five-carbon sugar are numbered 1′, 2′, 3′, 4′, and 5′ (1′ is read as “one prime”). The nucleotides combine with each other by covalent bonds known as phosphodiester bonds or linkages. &nbsp;The phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5′ carbon of one sugar of one nucleotide and the hydroxyl group of the 3′ carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, thereby forming a 5′-3′ phosphodiester bond.</p> <p>In the 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked together to determine the structure of DNA at the University of Cambridge, England.

In Wilkins’ lab, researcher Rosalind Franklin was using X-ray diffraction methods to understand the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick were able to piece together the puzzle of the DNA molecule on the basis of Franklin’s data because Crick had also studied X-ray diffraction (Figure&nbsp;2). In 1962, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.

The work of pioneering scientists (a) James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maclyn McCarty led to our present day understanding of DNA. Scientist Rosalind Franklin discovered (b) the X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA, which helped to elucidate its double helix structure. (credit a: modification of work by Marjorie McCarty, Public Library of Science)</p> </div> <p>Watson and Crick proposed that DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right-handed helix. Base pairing takes place between a purine and pyrimidine; namely, A pairs with T and G pairs with C. Adenine and thymine are complementary base pairs, and cytosine and guanine are also complementary base pairs. The base pairs are stabilized by hydrogen bonds; adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands are anti-parallel in nature; that is, the 3′ end of one strand faces the 5′ end of the other strand. The sugar and phosphate of the nucleotides form the backbone of the structure, whereas the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside. Each base pair is separated from the other base pair by a distance of 0.34 nm, and each turn of the helix measures 3.4 nm. Therefore, ten base pairs are present per turn of the helix. The diameter of the DNA double helix is 2 nm, and it is uniform throughout. Only the pairing between a purine and pyrimidine can explain the uniform diameter. The twisting of the two strands around each other results in the formation of uniformly spaced major and minor grooves (Figure&nbsp;3).</p> <div id="attachment_1422" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1422" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02183514/Figure_14_02_03abc-1024x353.jpg" alt="Part A shows an illustration of a DNA double helix, which has a sugar-phosphate backbone on the outside and nitrogenous base pairs on the inside.

DNA has (a) a double helix structure and (b) phosphodiester bonds. The (c) major and minor grooves are binding sites for DNA binding proteins during processes such as transcription (the copying of RNA from DNA) and replication.</p> </div> <h2>Genetic Information</h2> <p>The genetic information of an organism is stored in DNA molecules. How can one kind of molecule contain all the instructions for making complicated living beings like ourselves? What component or feature of DNA can contain this information? It has to come from the nitrogen bases, because, as you already know, the backbone of all DNA molecules is the same. But there are only four bases found in DNA: G, A, C, and T. The sequence of these four bases can provide all the instructions needed to build any living organism. It might be hard to imagine that 4 different “letters” can communicate so much information. But think about the English language, which can represent a huge amount of information using just 26 letters. Even more profound is the binary code used to write computer programs. This code contains only ones and zeros, and think of all the things your computer can do. The DNA alphabet can encode very complex instructions using just four letters, though the messages end up being really long. For example, the <em>E. coli</em> bacterium carries its genetic instructions in a DNA molecule that contains more than five million nucleotides. The human genome (all the DNA of an organism) consists of around three billion <strong>nucleotides</strong> divided up between 23 paired DNA molecules, or <strong>chromosomes</strong>.</p> <p>The information stored in the order of bases is organized into <strong>genes</strong>: each gene contains information for making a functional product. The genetic information is first copied to another <strong>nucleic acid polymer</strong>, <strong>RNA</strong> (ribonucleic acid), preserving the order of the nucleotide bases. Genes that contain instructions for making proteins are converted to messenger RNA (mRNA). Some specialized genes contain instructions for making functional RNA molecules that don’t make <strong>proteins</strong>. These RNA molecules function by affecting cellular processes directly; for example some of these RNA molecules regulate the expression of mRNA. Other genes produce RNA molecules that are required for <strong>protein synthesis</strong>, <strong>transfer RNA</strong> (<strong>tRNA</strong>), and <strong>ribosomal RNA</strong> (<strong>rRNA</strong>).</p> <p>In order for DNA to function effectively at storing information, two key processes are required. First, information stored in the DNA molecule must be copied, with minimal errors, every time a cell divides. This ensures that both daughter cells inherit the complete set of genetic information from the parent cell. Second, the information stored in the DNA molecule must be <strong>translated</strong>, or expressed. In order for the stored information to be useful, cells must be able to access the instructions for making specific proteins, so the correct proteins are made in the right place at the right time.</p> <div id="attachment_2600" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-2600" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/06151906/molecular_DNA.png" alt="Structure of DNA double helix.

DNA’s double helix. Graphic modified from “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DNA_chemical_structure.svg" target="_blank">DNA chemical structure</a>,” by Madeleine Price Ball, CC-BY-SA-2.0</p> </div> <p>Both copying and reading the information stored in DNA relies on base pairing between two <strong>nucleic acid</strong> polymer strands. Recall that DNA structure is a double helix (see Figure 4).</p> <p>The sugar deoxyribose with the <strong>phosphate group</strong> forms the scaffold or backbone of the molecule (highlighted in yellow in Figure 4). Bases point inward. Complementary bases form hydrogen bonds with each other within the double helix. See how the bigger bases (<strong>purines</strong>) pair with the smaller ones (<strong>pyrimidines</strong>). This keeps the width of the double helix constant. More specifically, A pairs with T and C pairs with G. As we discuss the function of DNA in subsequent sections, keep in mind that there is a chemical reason for specific pairing of bases.</p> <p>To illustrate the connection between information in DNA and an observable characteristic of an organism, let’s consider a gene that provides the instructions for building the hormone insulin. Insulin is responsible for regulating blood sugar levels. The insulin gene contains instructions for assembling the protein insulin from individual amino acids. Changing the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA molecule can change the amino acids in the final protein, leading to protein malfunction. If insulin does not function correctly, it might be unable to bind to another protein (insulin receptor). On the organismal level of organization, this molecular event (change of DNA sequence) can lead to a disease state—in this case, diabetes.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Questions</h3> <p>The order of nucleotides in a gene (in DNA) is the key to how information is stored.

<h2>DNA Packaging in Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes</h2>
<p>When comparing prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, prokaryotes are much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their features (Figure 5). Most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome that is found in an area of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid.</p>

<p>In eukaryotic cells, DNA and RNA synthesis occur in a separate compartment from protein synthesis. In prokaryotic cells, both processes occur together. What advantages might there be to separating the processes?</p>
<p><textarea rows="2" cols="50"></textarea></p> <div class="qa-wrapper" style="display: block"><span class="show-answer collapsed" style="cursor: pointer" data-target="q306617"><strong>Show Answer</strong></span> <div id="q306617" class="hidden-answer" style="display: none">What advantages might there be to having them occur together? Compartmentalization enables a eukaryotic cell to divide processes into discrete steps so it can build more complex protein and RNA products. But there is an advantage to having a single compartment as well: RNA and protein synthesis occurs much more quickly in a prokaryotic cell.</div> </div> </div> <p>The size of the genome in one of the most well-studied prokaryotes,&nbsp;<em>E.coli,</em> is 4.6 million base pairs (approximately 1.1 mm, if cut and stretched out). So how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell? The DNA is twisted by what is known as supercoiling. Supercoiling means that DNA is either under-wound (less than one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs) or over-wound (more than 1 turn per 10 base pairs) from its normal relaxed state. Some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling; other proteins and enzymes such as DNA gyrase help in maintaining the supercoiled structure.</p> <p>Eukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule, employ a different type of packing strategy to fit their DNA inside the nucleus (Figure 6). At the most basic level, DNA is wrapped around proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. The histones are evolutionarily conserved proteins that are rich in basic amino acids and form an octamer. The DNA (which is negatively charged because of the phosphate groups) is wrapped tightly around the histone core. This nucleosome is linked to the next one with the help of a linker DNA. This is also known as the “beads on a string” structure. This is further compacted into a 30 nm fiber, which is the diameter of the structure. At the metaphase stage, the chromosomes are at their most compact, are approximately 700 nm in width, and are found in association with scaffold proteins.</p> <p>In interphase, eukaryotic chromosomes have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining. The tightly packaged region is known as heterochromatin, and the less dense region is known as euchromatin. Heterochromatin usually contains genes that are not expressed, and is found in the regions of the centromere and telomeres. The euchromatin usually contains genes that are transcribed, with DNA packaged around nucleosomes but not further compacted.</p> <div id="attachment_1426" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1426" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02184023/Figure_14_02_07.jpg" alt="Illustration shows the levels of organization of eukaryotic chromosomes, starting with the DNA double helix, which wraps around histone proteins.

Friedrich Miescher (1844–1895) discovered nucleic acids.</p> </div> <p>Modern understandings of DNA have evolved from the discovery of nucleic acid to the development of the double-helix model. In the 1860s, Friedrich Miescher (Figure 1), a physician by profession, was the first person to isolate phosphate-rich chemicals from white blood cells or leukocytes. He named these chemicals (which would eventually be known as RNA and DNA) nuclein because they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells.</p> <p>To see Miescher conduct an experiment step-by-step, click through this <a href="https://www.dnalc.org/view/16342-Animation-15-DNA-and-proteins-are-key-molecules-of-the-cell-nucleus-.html" target="_blank">review of how he discovered the key role of DNA and proteins in the nucleus</a>.</p> <p>A half century later, British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary information could be transferred from one cell to another “horizontally,” rather than by descent. In 1928, he reported the first demonstration of bacterial <strong>transformation</strong>, a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell, thereby changing morphology and physiology. He was working with <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae,</em> the bacterium that causes pneumonia. Griffith worked with two strains, rough (R) and smooth (S). The R strain is non-pathogenic (does not cause disease) and is called rough because its outer surface is a cell wall and lacks a capsule; as a result, the cell surface appears uneven under the microscope. The S strain is pathogenic (disease-causing) and has a capsule outside its cell wall. As a result, it has a smooth appearance under the microscope. Griffith injected the live R strain into mice and they survived. In another experiment, when he injected mice with the heat-killed S strain, they also survived. In a third set of experiments, a mixture of live R strain and heat-killed S strain were injected into mice, and—to his surprise—the mice died. Upon isolating the live bacteria from the dead mouse, only the S strain of bacteria was recovered. When this isolated S strain was injected into fresh mice, the mice died. Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain into the live R strain and transformed it into the pathogenic S strain, and he called this the transforming principle (Figure 2). These experiments are now famously known as Griffith’s transformation experiments.</p> <div id="attachment_2595" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-2595" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/06150941/Figure_14_01_02.jpg" alt="On the left is a photo of a live mouse, representing a mouse injected with heat-killed, virulent S strain.

Two strains of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> were used in Griffith’s transformation experiments. The R strain is non-pathogenic. The S strain is pathogenic and causes death. When Griffith injected a mouse with the heat-killed S strain and a live R strain, the mouse died. The S strain was recovered from the dead mouse. Thus, Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain to the R strain, transforming the R strain into S strain in the process. (credit “living mouse”: modification of work by NIH; credit “dead mouse”: modification of work by Sarah Marriage)</p> </div> <p>Scientists Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty (1944) were interested in exploring this transforming principle further. They isolated the S strain from the dead mice and isolated the proteins and nucleic acids, namely RNA and DNA, as these were possible candidates for the molecule of heredity. They conducted a systematic elimination study. They used enzymes that specifically degraded each component and then used each mixture separately to transform the R strain. They found that when DNA was degraded, the resulting mixture was no longer able to transform the bacteria, whereas all of the other combinations were able to transform the bacteria. This led them to conclude that DNA was the transforming principle.</p> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>Forensic Scientists and DNA Analysis</h3> <p>DNA evidence was used for the first time to solve an immigration case. The story started with a teenage boy returning to London from Ghana to be with his mother. Immigration authorities at the airport were suspicious of him, thinking that he was traveling on a forged passport. After much persuasion, he was allowed to go live with his mother, but the immigration authorities did not drop the case against him. All types of evidence, including photographs, were provided to the authorities, but deportation proceedings were started nevertheless. Around the same time, Dr. Alec Jeffreys of Leicester University in the United Kingdom had invented a technique known as DNA fingerprinting. The immigration authorities approached Dr. Jeffreys for help. He took DNA samples from the mother and three of her children, plus an unrelated mother, and compared the samples with the boy’s DNA. Because the biological father was not in the picture, DNA from the three children was compared with the boy’s DNA. He found a match in the boy’s DNA for both the mother and his three siblings. He concluded that the boy was indeed the mother’s son.</p> <p>Forensic scientists analyze many items, including documents, handwriting, firearms, and biological samples. They analyze the DNA content of hair, semen, saliva, and blood, and compare it with a database of DNA profiles of known criminals. Analysis includes DNA isolation, sequencing, and sequence analysis; most forensic DNA analysis involves polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of short tandem repeat (STR) loci and electrophoresis to determine the length of the PCR-amplified fragment. Only mitochondrial DNA is sequenced for forensics. Forensic scientists are expected to appear at court hearings to present their findings. They are usually employed in crime labs of city and state government agencies. Geneticists experimenting with DNA techniques also work for scientific and research organizations, pharmaceutical industries, and college and university labs. Students wishing to pursue a career as a forensic scientist should have at least a bachelor’s degree in chemistry, biology, or physics, and preferably some experience working in a laboratory.</p> </div> <p>Experiments conducted by Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey in 1952 provided confirmatory evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins. Chase and Hershey were studying a bacteriophage, which is a virus that infects bacteria. Viruses typically have a simple structure: a protein coat, called the capsid, and a nucleic acid core that contains the genetic material, either DNA or RNA. The bacteriophage infects the host bacterial cell by attaching to its surface, and then it injects its nucleic acids inside the cell. The phage DNA makes multiple copies of itself using the host machinery, and eventually the host cell bursts, releasing a large number of bacteriophages. Hershey and Chase labeled one batch of phage with radioactive sulfur, <sup>35</sup>S, to label the protein coat. Another batch of phage were labeled with radioactive phosphorus, <sup>32</sup>P. Because phosphorous is found in DNA, but not protein, the DNA and not the protein would be tagged with radioactive phosphorus.</p> <p>Each batch of phage was allowed to infect the cells separately. After infection, the phage bacterial suspension was put in a blender, which caused the phage coat to be detached from the host cell. The phage and bacterial suspension was spun down in a centrifuge. The heavier bacterial cells settled down and formed a pellet, whereas the lighter phage particles stayed in the supernatant. In the tube that contained phage labeled with <sup>35</sup>S, the supernatant contained the radioactively labeled phage, whereas no radioactivity was detected in the pellet. In the tube that contained the phage labeled with <sup>32</sup>P, the radioactivity was detected in the pellet that contained the heavier bacterial cells, and no radioactivity was detected in the supernatant. Hershey and Chase concluded that it was the phage DNA that was injected into the cell and carried information to produce more phage particles, thus providing evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins (Figure 3).</p> <div id="attachment_2596" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-2596" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/06151133/Figure_14_01_03.jpg" alt="Illustration shows bacteria being infected by phage labeled with ^{35}S, which is incorporated into the protein coat, or ^{32}P, which is incorporated into the DNA.

He found that the amount of adenine equals the amount of thymine, and the amount of cytosine equals the amount of guanine, or A = T and G = C. This is also known as Chargaff’s rules.

The three suggested models of DNA replication.

This model suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. What was not clear was how the replication took place. There were three models suggested: conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive (see Figure 4).</p> <p>In conservative replication, the parental DNA remains together, and the newly formed daughter strands are together. The semi-conservative method suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands act as a template for new DNA to be synthesized; after replication, each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or “old” strand and one “new” strand.

The cells were harvested and the DNA was isolated. The DNA was centrifuged at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge. Some cells were allowed to grow for one more life cycle in <sup>14</sup>N and spun again. During the density gradient centrifugation, the DNA is loaded into a gradient (typically a salt such as cesium chloride or sucrose) and spun at high speeds of 50,000 to 60,000 rpm. Under these circumstances, the DNA will form a band according to its density in the gradient. DNA grown in <sup>15</sup>N will band at a higher density position than that grown in <sup>14</sup>N. Meselson and Stahl noted that after one generation of growth in <sup>14</sup>N after they had been shifted from <sup>15</sup>N, the single band observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of cells grown exclusively in <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>14</sup>N. This suggested either a semi-conservative or dispersive mode of replication. The DNA harvested from cells grown for two generations in <sup>14</sup>N formed two bands: one DNA band was at the intermediate position between <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>14</sup>N, and the other corresponded to the band of <sup>14</sup>N DNA. These results could only be explained if DNA replicates in a semi-conservative manner. Therefore, the other two modes were ruled out.</p> <p>During DNA replication, each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which new strands are copied.

One double stranded DNA molecule, when replicated, will become two double-stranded molecules, each containing one original strand and one newly synthesized strand. You remember that the two strands of DNA run antiparallel: one from the 5′ to the 3′, and the other from the 3′ to the 5′. The synthesis of the new DNA strand can only happen in one direction: from the 5′ to the 3′ end. In other words, the new bases are always added to the 3′ end of the newly synthesized DNA strand. So if the new nucleotide is always added to the 3′ end of an existing nucleotide, where does the <em class="bold">first</em> nucleotide come from? In fact, <strong>DNA polymerase</strong> needs an “anchor” to start adding nucleotides: a short sequence of DNA or RNA that is complementary to the template strand will work to provide a free 3′ end. This sequence is called a <em>primer&nbsp;</em>(Figure 7).</p> <div id="attachment_2571" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2571" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02172346/RNA.jpg" alt="Diagram of a primer moving along the template strand of DNA." width="600" height="273" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02172346/RNA.jpg 470w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02172346/RNA-300x137.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02172346/RNA-65x30.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02172346/RNA-225x102.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02172346/RNA-350x159.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 7. Primer and Template</p> </div> <p>How does <strong>DNA polymerase</strong> know in what order to add nucleotides? Specific base pairing in DNA is the key to copying the DNA: if you know the sequence of one strand, you can use base pairing rules to build the other strand. Bases form pairs (base pairs) in a very specific way. Figure 8&nbsp;shows how <em>A</em> (adenine) pairs with <em>T</em> (thymine) and <em>G</em> (guanine) pairs with <em>C</em> (cytosine). It is important to remember that this binding is specific: <em>T</em> pairs with <em>A</em>, but not with <em>C</em>. The molecular recognition occurs because of the ability of bases to form specific hydrogen bonds: atoms align just right to make hydrogen bonds possible. Also note that a larger base (purine, <em>A</em> or <em>G</em>) always pairs with a smaller base (pyrimidine, <em>C</em> or <em>T</em>).</p> <div id="attachment_2572" style="width: 538px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2572 size-full" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/02172431/Molecular-DNA.png" alt="Diagram showing the hydrogen bonds between nucleotides.

The two strands of&nbsp;DNA have to be temporarily separated from each other; this job is done by a special enzyme, <em>helicase</em>, that helps unwind and separate the DNA helices (Figure 9). Another issue is that the <strong>DNA polymerase</strong> only works in one direction along the strand (5′ to 3′), but the double-stranded DNA has two strands oriented in opposite directions. This problem is solved by synthesizing the two strands slightly differently: one new strand grows continuously, the other in bits and pieces.

Uncorrected mistakes may sometimes lead to serious consequences, such as cancer. Repair mechanisms correct the mistakes. In rare cases, mistakes are not corrected, leading to mutations; in other cases, repair enzymes are themselves mutated or defective.</p> <p>Most of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by DNA polymerase by proofreading the base that has been just added (Figure 10). In <strong>proofreading</strong>, the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one, so a correction can be made. The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand. If it is the right base, the next nucleotide is added. If an incorrect base has been added, the enzyme makes a cut at the phosphodiester bond and releases the wrong nucleotide. This is performed by the exonuclease action of DNA pol III. Once the incorrect nucleotide has been removed, a new one will be added again.</p> <div id="attachment_1436" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1436" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02184707/Figure_14_06_01.jpg" alt="Illustration shows DNA polymerase replicating a strand of DNA.

Proofreading by DNA polymerase corrects errors during replication.</p> </div> <p>Some errors are not corrected during replication, but are instead corrected after replication is completed; this type of repair is known as&nbsp;<strong>mismatch repair </strong>(Figure 11). The enzymes recognize the incorrectly added nucleotide and excise it; this is then replaced by the correct base. If this remains uncorrected, it may lead to more permanent damage. How do mismatch repair enzymes recognize which of the two bases is the incorrect one? In <em>E. coli</em>, after replication, the nitrogenous base adenine acquires a methyl group; the parental DNA strand will have methyl groups, whereas the newly synthesized strand lacks them. Thus, DNA polymerase is able to remove the wrongly incorporated bases from the newly synthesized, non-methylated strand. In eukaryotes, the mechanism is not very well understood, but it is believed to involve recognition of unsealed nicks in the new strand, as well as a short-term continuing association of some of the replication proteins with the new daughter strand after replication has completed.</p> <div id="attachment_4553" style="width: 1247px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-4553" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/03/23213100/Figure_14_06_02ab.jpg" alt="The top illustration shows a replicated DNA strand with G-T base mismatch.

Once the bases are filled in, the remaining gap is sealed with a phosphodiester linkage catalyzed by DNA ligase. This repair mechanism is often employed when UV exposure causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers.</p> <h2>Telomeres</h2> <p>As you’ve learned, the enzyme DNA pol can add nucleotides only in the 5′ to 3′ direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is reached. On the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer. When the replication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no place for a primer to be made for the DNA fragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome. These ends thus remain unpaired, and over time these ends may get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide.</p> <p>The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as&nbsp;<strong>telomeres</strong>, which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene. In a way, these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide. In humans, a six base pair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times. The discovery of the enzyme telomerase (Figure 13) helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained. The <strong>telomerase</strong> enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built-in RNA template. It attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the 3′ end of the DNA strand. Once the 3′ end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can add the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. Thus, the ends of the chromosomes are replicated.</p> <div id="attachment_1432" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1432" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02184502/Figure_14_05_01.jpg" alt="Telomerase has an associated RNA that complements the 5 prime overhang at the end of the chromosome.

Elizabeth Blackburn, 2009 Nobel Laureate, is the scientist who discovered how telomerase works. (credit: US Embassy Sweden)</p> </div> <p>Telomerase is typically active in germ cells and adult stem cells. It is not active in adult somatic cells. For her discovery of telomerase and its action, Elizabeth Blackburn (Figure 14) received the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 2009.</p> <h3>Telomerase and Aging</h3> <p>Cells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened because most somatic cells do not make telomerase. This essentially means that telomere shortening is associated with aging. With the advent of modern medicine, preventative health care, and healthier lifestyles, the human life span has increased, and there is an increasing demand for people to look younger and have a better quality of life as they grow older.</p> <p>In 2010, scientists found that telomerase can reverse some age-related conditions in mice. This may have potential in regenerative medicine.<span class="footnote">Jaskelioff et al., “Telomerase reactivation reverses tissue degeneration in aged telomerase-deficient mice,” <em>Nature</em> 469 (2011): 102–7.</span>&nbsp;Telomerase-deficient mice were used in these studies; these mice have tissue atrophy, stem cell depletion, organ system failure, and impaired tissue injury responses. Telomerase reactivation in these mice caused extension of telomeres, reduced DNA damage, reversed neurodegeneration, and improved the function of the testes, spleen, and intestines. Thus, telomere reactivation may have potential for treating age-related diseases in humans.</p> <p>Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells. The cells accumulate mutations, proliferate uncontrollably, and can migrate to different parts of the body through a process called metastasis. Scientists have observed that cancerous cells have considerably shortened telomeres and that telomerase is active in these cells. Interestingly, only after the telomeres were shortened in the cancer cells did the telomerase become active. If the action of telomerase in these cells can be inhibited by drugs during cancer therapy, then the cancerous cells could potentially be stopped from further division.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>In Summary: DNA Base Pairs and Replication</h3> <p>DNA was first isolated from white blood cells by Friedrich Miescher, who called it nuclein because it was isolated from nuclei. Frederick Griffith’s experiments with strains of <em data-effect="italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> provided the first hint that DNA may be the transforming principle. Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty proved that DNA is required for the transformation of bacteria. Later experiments by Hershey and Chase using bacteriophage T2 proved that DNA is the genetic material. Chargaff found that the ratio of A = T and C = G, and that the percentage content of A, T, G, and C is different for different species.</p> <p>The model for DNA replication suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. In conservative replication, the parental DNA is conserved, and the daughter DNA is newly synthesized. The semi-conservative method suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands acts as template for new DNA to be synthesized; after replication, each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or “old” strand and one “new” strand. The dispersive mode suggested that the two copies of the DNA would have segments of parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA. Experimental evidence showed DNA replication is semi-conservative.</p> <p>Replication in eukaryotes starts at multiple origins of replication. A primer is required to initiate synthesis, which is then extended by DNA polymerase as it adds nucleotides one by one to the growing chain. The leading strand is synthesized continuously, whereas the lagging strand is synthesized in short stretches called Okazaki fragments. The RNA primers are replaced with DNA nucleotides; the DNA remains one continuous strand by linking the DNA fragments with DNA ligase. Below is a summary table of the major enzymes addressed in this reading, listed in rough order of activity during replication.</p> <p>The ends of the chromosomes pose a problem during DNA replication as polymerase is unable to extend them without a primer. Telomerase, an enzyme with a built-in RNA template, extends the ends by copying the RNA template and extending one end of the chromosome. DNA polymerase can then extend the DNA using the primer. In this way, the ends of the chromosomes are protected. This is important as evidence indicates telomere length may play a role in regulating cell division and the process of aging.</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

An illustration to show an example of a DNA mutation.&nbsp;Image credit: Genome Research Limited</p> </div> </div> <h2>Mutations in Somatic Cells and in Gametes</h2> <p>Let’s begin with a question: <em>What is a gene mutation and how do mutations occur?</em></p> <p>A gene mutation is a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene, such that the sequence differs from what is found in most people. Mutations range in size; they can affect anywhere from a single DNA building block (base pair) to a large segment of a chromosome that includes multiple genes.</p> <p>Gene mutations can be classified in two major ways:</p> <ul><li><strong>Hereditary mutations</strong> are inherited from a parent and are present throughout a person’s life in virtually every cell in the body. These mutations are also called germline mutations because they are present in the parent’s egg or sperm cells, which are also called germ cells. When an egg and a sperm cell unite, the resulting fertilized egg cell receives DNA from both parents. If this DNA has a mutation, the child that grows from the fertilized egg will have the mutation in each of his or her cells.</li> <li><strong>Acquired (or somatic) mutations</strong> occur at some time during a person’s life and are present only in certain cells, not in every cell in the body. These changes can be caused by environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation from the sun, or can occur if a mistake is made as DNA copies itself during cell division. Acquired mutations in somatic cells (cells other than sperm and egg cells) cannot be passed on to the next generation.</li> </ul> <p>Genetic changes that are described as de novo (new) mutations can be either hereditary or somatic. In some cases, the mutation occurs in a person’s egg or sperm cell but is not present in any of the person’s other cells. In other cases, the mutation occurs in the fertilized egg shortly after the egg and sperm cells unite. (It is often impossible to tell exactly when a de novo mutation happened.) As the fertilized egg divides, each resulting cell in the growing embryo will have the mutation. De novo mutations may explain genetic disorders in which an affected child has a mutation in every cell in the body but the parents do not, and there is no family history of the disorder.</p> <p>Somatic mutations that happen in a single cell early in embryonic development can lead to a situation called mosaicism. These genetic changes are not present in a parent’s egg or sperm cells, or in the fertilized egg, but happen a bit later when the embryo includes several cells. As all the cells divide during growth and development, cells that arise from the cell with the altered gene will have the mutation, while other cells will not. Depending on the mutation and how many cells are affected, mosaicism may or may not cause health problems.</p> <p>Most disease-causing gene mutations are uncommon in the general population. However, other genetic changes occur more frequently. Genetic alterations that occur in more than 1 percent of the population are called polymorphisms. They are common enough to be considered a normal variation in the DNA. Polymorphisms are responsible for many of the normal differences between people such as eye color, hair color, and blood type. Although many polymorphisms have no negative effects on a person’s health, some of these variations may influence the risk of developing certain disorders.</p> <h2>Major Types of Mutations</h2> <div id="attachment_1440" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1440" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02184924/Figure_14_06_04-300x253.jpg" alt="Photo shows a person with mottled skin lesions that result from xermoderma pigmentosa." width="300" height="253" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02184924/Figure_14_06_04-300x253.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02184924/Figure_14_06_04-768x648.jpg 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02184924/Figure_14_06_04-1024x864.jpg 1024w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02184924/Figure_14_06_04-65x55.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02184924/Figure_14_06_04-225x190.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02184924/Figure_14_06_04-350x295.jpg 350w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02184924/Figure_14_06_04.jpg 1270w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2. Xeroderma pigmentosa is a condition in which thymine dimerization from exposure to UV is not repaired. Exposure to sunlight results in skin lesions. (credit: James Halpern et al.)</p> </div> <p>A well-studied example of a mutation&nbsp;is seen in people suffering from xeroderma pigmentosa (Figure 2). Affected individuals have skin that is highly sensitive to UV rays from the sun.</p> <p>When individuals are exposed to UV, pyrimidine dimers, especially those of thymine, are formed; people with xeroderma pigmentosa are not able to repair the damage. These are not repaired because of a defect in the nucleotide excision repair enzymes, whereas in normal individuals, the thymine dimers are excised and the defect is corrected. The thymine dimers distort the structure of the DNA double helix, and this may cause problems during DNA replication. People with xeroderma pigmentosa may have a higher risk of contracting skin cancer than those who don’t have the condition.</p> <p>Errors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA.&nbsp;<strong>Mutations</strong>, variations in the nucleotide sequence of a genome, can also occur because of damage to DNA. Such mutations may be of two types: induced or spontaneous. <strong>Induced mutations</strong> are those that result from an exposure to chemicals, UV rays, x-rays, or some other environmental agent. <strong>Spontaneous mutations</strong> occur without any exposure to any environmental agent; they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body.</p> <p>Mutations may have a wide range of effects. Some mutations are not expressed; these are known as&nbsp;<strong>silent mutations</strong>. <strong>Point mutations</strong> are those mutations that affect a single base pair. The most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions, in which one base is replaced by another. These can be of two types, either transitions or transversions. <strong>Transition substitution</strong> refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind; for example, a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine. Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine, or vice versa; for example, cytosine, a pyrimidine, is replaced by adenine, a purine. Mutations can also be the result of the addition of a base, known as an insertion, or the removal of a base, also known as deletion. Sometimes a piece of DNA from one chromosome may get moved to another chromosome or to another region of the same chromosome; this is also known as translocation.</p> <p>Mutations in repair genes have been known to cause cancer. Many mutated repair genes have been implicated in certain forms of pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and colorectal cancer. Mutations can affect either somatic cells or germ cells. If many mutations accumulate in a somatic cell, they may lead to problems such as the uncontrolled cell division observed in cancer. If a mutation takes place in germ cells, the mutation will be passed on to the next generation, as in the case of hemophilia and xeroderma pigmentosa.</p> <h2>The Causes of Genetic Mutations</h2> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rtUoWyIE1FM/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &quot;The causes of genetic mutations | Biomolecules | MCAT | Khan Academy&quot;" title="The causes of genetic mutations | Biomolecules | MCAT | Khan Academy" /> <p>A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Within any given genome there will be small differences in the DNA sequence. All humans, for example, are 99.99% identical and only differ by 0.01%. These small differences account for many features in an individual, including how he or she responds to disease treatments.</p> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>Personalized Medicine in Practice</h3> <p>Let&#8217;s return to our examples from the beginning of the module:</p> <ul><li><strong>Blood clot treatments: </strong>Screening the genome of a patient prior to prescribing Warafin for blood clots allows clinicians to determine if the drug will even work and if so, to pinpoint a specific dosage.</li> <li><strong>Colorectal cancer treatments: </strong>In the case of colorectal cancer, the KRAS protein can be examined to determine if cetuximab will be effective. This is an important step as this drug is ineffective in about 40% of patients.</li> <li><strong>Breast cancer treatments:</strong> Anti-breast cancer treatments can be assessed prior to trial-and-error in a patient based on the DNA sequence of key receptors in the body.</li> </ul> </div> <p>So, should you have your genes tested? Unfortunately, the decision about whether to get a particular genetic test can be complicated.</p> <p><img class="alignright wp-image-4083" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/06001015/16068674648_383d653ccb_b.jpg" alt="A doctor holding a file folder of information" width="300" height="416" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/06001015/16068674648_383d653ccb_b.jpg 588w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/06001015/16068674648_383d653ccb_b-217x300.jpg 217w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/06001015/16068674648_383d653ccb_b-65x90.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/06001015/16068674648_383d653ccb_b-225x311.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/06001015/16068674648_383d653ccb_b-350x485.jpg 350w" />Getting a genetic test usually isn’t difficult. Doctors generally take a sample of body fluid or tissue, such as blood, saliva or skin, and send it to a lab. Most genetic tests used today analyze just one or a few genes, often to help diagnose disease. Newborns, for example, are routinely screened for several genetic disorders by taking a few drops of blood from their heels. When life-threatening conditions are caught early, infants can be treated right away to prevent problems.</p> <p>Genetic tests are now available for about 2,500 diseases, and that number keeps growing. Your doctor might advise you to get tested for specific genetic diseases if they tend to run in your family or if you have certain symptoms.</p> <p>“While there are many genetic tests, they vary as to how well they predict risk,” says Dr. Lawrence Brody, a genetic testing expert at NIH.</p> <p>For some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis, inheriting 2 copies of abnormal genes means a person will get that disease. But for other diseases and conditions, the picture is more complex. For type 2 diabetes, testing positive for some specific gene variants may help predict risk, but no better than other factors—such as obesity, high blood pressure and having a close relative with the disease.</p> <p>The latest approach to personalized medicine is to get your whole genome sequenced. That’s still expensive, but the cost has dropped dramatically over the past decade and will likely continue to fall. Since your genome essentially stays the same over time, this information might one day become part of your medical record, so doctors could consult it as needed.</p> <p>You can start to get a sense of your genetic risks by putting together your family’s health history. A free online tool called <a href="https://familyhistory.hhs.gov/FHH/html/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Family Health Portrait</a> from the U.S. Surgeon General can help you and your doctor spot early warning signs of conditions that run in your family.</p> <p>But personalized medicine isn’t just about genes. You can learn a lot about your health risks by taking a close look at your current health and habits. Smoking, a poor diet, and lack of exercise can raise your risks for life-threatening health problems, such as heart disease and cancer. Talk to your health care provider about the steps you can take to understand and reduce your unique health risks.</p> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>Learn More</h3> <p>Visit this site to learn more about how <a href="http://www.fda.gov/scienceresearch/specialtopics/personalizedmedicine/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FDA regulations</a> come into play.</p> </div> </div><div class="licensing"><div class="license-attribution-dropdown-subheading">CC licensed content, Original</div><ul class="citation-list"><li>Putting It Together: DNA Structure and Replication. <strong>Authored by</strong>: Shelli Carter and Lumen Learning. <strong>Provided by</strong>: Lumen Learning. <strong>License</strong>: <em><a target="_blank" rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY: Attribution</a></em></li></ul><div class="license-attribution-dropdown-subheading">CC licensed content, Shared previously</div><ul class="citation-list"><li>adult, africa, african, black, care, cheerful, clinic, doctor,. <strong>Authored by</strong>: Ilmicrofono Oggiono . <strong>Provided by</strong>: www.audio-luci-store.it. <strong>Located at</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="https://flic.kr/p/qtWa9C">https://flic.kr/p/qtWa9C</a>. <strong>License</strong>: <em><a target="_blank" rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY: Attribution</a></em></li></ul><div class="license-attribution-dropdown-subheading">Public domain content</div><ul class="citation-list"><li>Personalized Medicine: Matching Treatments to Your Genes. <strong>Authored by</strong>: Vicki Contie, Dana Steinberg, Carol Torgan, and Katherine Wendelsdorf. <strong>Provided by</strong>: NIH. <strong>Located at</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/issue/dec2013/feature1">https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/issue/dec2013/feature1</a>. <strong>License</strong>: <em><a target="_blank" rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/about/pdm">Public Domain: No Known Copyright</a></em></li></ul></div>

Transcription occurs in the three steps—initiation, elongation, and termination—all shown here.</p> </div> <h3>Step 1: Initiation</h3> <p><strong>Initiation</strong> is the beginning of transcription. It occurs when the enzyme RNA polymerase binds to a region of a gene called the promoter. This signals the DNA to unwind so the enzyme can ‘‘read’’ the bases in one of the DNA strands. The enzyme is now ready to make a strand of mRNA with a complementary sequence of bases.</p> <h3>Step 2: Elongation</h3> <p><strong>Elongation</strong> is the addition of nucleotides to the mRNA strand. RNA polymerase reads the unwound DNA strand and builds the mRNA molecule, using complementary base pairs. There is a brief time during this process when the newly formed RNA is bound to the unwound DNA. During this process, an adenine (A) in the DNA binds to an uracil (U) in the RNA.</p> <h3>Step 3: Termination</h3> <p><strong>Termination</strong> is the ending of transcription, and occurs when RNA polymerase crosses a stop (termination) sequence in the gene. The mRNA strand is complete, and it detaches from DNA.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p>This video provides a review of these steps. You can stop watching the video at 5:35.

Read on to learn the role of RNA polymerases at each stage of transcription.</p> <h3>Initiation of Transcription</h3> <p>Unlike the prokaryotic polymerase that can bind to a DNA template on its own, eukaryotes require several other proteins, called transcription factors, to first bind to the promoter region and then help recruit the appropriate polymerase.</p> <h4>The Three Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases</h4> <p>The features of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis are markedly more complex those of prokaryotes. Instead of a single polymerase comprising five subunits, the eukaryotes have three polymerases that are each made up of 10 subunits or more. Each eukaryotic polymerase also requires a distinct set of transcription factors to bring it to the DNA template.</p> <p>RNA polymerase I is located in the nucleolus, a specialized nuclear substructure in which ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes (Table 1). The rRNA molecules are considered structural RNAs because they have a cellular role but are not translated into protein. The rRNAs are components of the ribosome and are essential to the process of translation. RNA polymerase I synthesizes all of the rRNAs except for the 5S rRNA molecule. The “S” designation applies to “Svedberg” units, a nonadditive value that characterizes the speed at which a particle sediments during centrifugation.</p> <table><thead><tr><th colspan="4">Table 1.

Eukaryotic pre-mRNAs undergo extensive processing after transcription but before translation (Figure 3). For clarity, this module’s discussion of transcription and translation in eukaryotes will use the term “mRNAs” to describe only the mature, processed molecules that are ready to be translated. RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcribing the overwhelming majority of eukaryotic genes.</p> <div id="attachment_1448" style="width: 479px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1448 size-full" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02190127/Figure_15_03_02.png" alt="An illustration shows that before RNA processing, there is a primary RNA transcript including five boxes labeled, left to right, as exon 1, intron, exon 2, intron, and exon 3.

Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be spliced out. A 5′ cap and 3′ poly-A tail are also added.</p> </div> <p>RNA polymerase III is also located in the nucleus. This polymerase transcribes a variety of structural RNAs that includes the 5S pre-rRNA, transfer pre-RNAs (pre-tRNAs), and&nbsp;<strong>small nuclear</strong> pre-<strong>RNAs</strong>. The tRNAs have a critical role in translation; they serve as the adaptor molecules between the mRNA template and the growing polypeptide chain. Small nuclear RNAs have a variety of functions, including “splicing” pre-mRNAs and regulating transcription factors.</p> <p>A scientist characterizing a new gene can determine which polymerase transcribes it by testing whether the gene is expressed in the presence of a particular mushroom poison, α-amanitin (Table 1). Interestingly, α-amanitin produced by&nbsp;<em>Amanita phalloides</em>, the Death Cap mushroom, affects the three polymerases very differently. RNA polymerase I is completely insensitive to α-amanitin, meaning that the polymerase can transcribe DNA in vitro in the presence of this poison. In contrast, RNA polymerase II is extremely sensitive to α-amanitin, and RNA polymerase III is moderately sensitive. Knowing the transcribing polymerase can clue a researcher into the general function of the gene being studied. Because RNA polymerase II transcribes the vast majority of genes, we will focus on this polymerase in our subsequent discussions about eukaryotic transcription factors and promoters.</p> <h4>Structure of an RNA Polymerase II Promoter</h4> <p>Eukaryotic promoters are much larger and more complex than prokaryotic promoters, but both have a TATA box. For example, in the mouse thymidine kinase gene, the TATA box is located at approximately -30 relative to the initiation (+1) site (Figure 4). For this gene, the exact TATA box sequence is TATAAAA, as read in the 5′ to 3′ direction on the nontemplate strand.&nbsp;The thermostability of A–T bonds is low and this helps the DNA template to locally unwind in preparation for transcription.</p> <div id="attachment_1454" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1454" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02190621/Figure_15_03_01.jpg" alt="Illustration shows a series of transcription factors binding to the promoter, which is upstream of the gene.

A generalized promoter of a gene transcribed by RNA polymerase II is shown. Transcription factors recognize the promoter. RNA polymerase II then binds and forms the transcription initiation complex.</p> </div> <p>The mouse genome includes one gene and two pseudogenes for cytoplasmic thymidine kinase. Pseudogenes are genes that have lost their protein-coding ability or are no longer expressed by the cell. These pseudogenes are copied from mRNA and incorporated into the chromosome. For example, the mouse thymidine kinase promoter also has a conserved&nbsp;<strong>CAAT box</strong> (GGCCAATCT) at approximately -80. This sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors. Further upstream of the TATA box, eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more <strong>GC-rich boxes</strong> (GGCG) or <strong>octamer boxes</strong> (ATTTGCAT). These elements bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription initiation and are often identified in more “active” genes that are constantly being expressed by the cell.</p> <h4>Transcription Factors for RNA Polymerase II</h4> <p>The complexity of eukaryotic transcription does not end with the polymerases and promoters. An army of basal transcription factors, enhancers, and silencers also help to regulate the frequency with which pre-mRNA is synthesized from a gene. Enhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of transcription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed. Basal transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a&nbsp;<strong>preinitiation complex</strong> on the DNA template that subsequently recruits RNA polymerase II for transcription initiation.</p> <p>The names of the basal transcription factors begin with “TFII” (this is the transcription factor for RNA polymerase II) and are specified with the letters A–J. The transcription factors systematically fall into place on the DNA template, with each one further stabilizing the preinitiation complex and contributing to the recruitment of RNA polymerase II.</p> <p>The processes of bringing RNA polymerases I and III to the DNA template involve slightly less complex collections of transcription factors, but the general theme is the same. Eukaryotic transcription is a tightly regulated process that requires a variety of proteins to interact with each other and with the DNA strand. Although the process of transcription in eukaryotes involves a greater metabolic investment than in prokaryotes, it ensures that the cell transcribes precisely the pre-mRNAs that it needs for protein synthesis.</p> <div class="key-takeaways textbox"><h3>The Evolution of Promoters</h3> <p>The evolution of genes may be a familiar concept. Mutations can occur in genes during DNA replication, and the result may or may not be beneficial to the cell. By altering an enzyme, structural protein, or some other factor, the process of mutation can transform functions or physical features. However, eukaryotic promoters and other gene regulatory sequences may evolve as well. For instance, consider a gene that, over many generations, becomes more valuable to the cell. Maybe the gene encodes a structural protein that the cell needs to synthesize in abundance for a certain function. If this is the case, it would be beneficial to the cell for that gene’s promoter to recruit transcription factors more efficiently and increase gene expression.</p> <p>Scientists examining the evolution of promoter sequences have reported varying results. In part, this is because it is difficult to infer exactly where a eukaryotic promoter begins and ends. Some promoters occur within genes; others are located very far upstream, or even downstream, of the genes they are regulating. However, when researchers limited their examination to human core promoter sequences that were defined experimentally as sequences that bind the preinitiation complex, they found that promoters evolve even faster than protein-coding genes.</p> <p>It is still unclear how promoter evolution might correspond to the evolution of humans or other higher organisms. However, the evolution of a promoter to effectively make more or less of a given gene product is an intriguing alternative to the evolution of the genes themselves.<span class="footnote">H Liang et al., "Fast evolution of core promoters in primate genomes,"&nbsp;<em>Molecular Biology and Evolution</em> 25 (2008): 1239–44.</span></p> </div> <h4>Promoter Structures for RNA Polymerases I and III</h4> <p>In eukaryotes, the conserved promoter elements differ for genes transcribed by RNA polymerases I, II, and III. RNA polymerase I transcribes genes that have two GC-rich promoter sequences in the –45 to +20 region. These sequences alone are sufficient for transcription initiation to occur, but promoters with additional sequences in the region from –180 to –105 upstream of the initiation site will further enhance initiation. Genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III have upstream promoters or promoters that occur within the genes themselves.</p> <h3>Elongation and Termination</h3> <p>Following the formation of the preinitiation complex, the polymerase is released from the other transcription factors, and elongation is allowed to proceed as it does in prokaryotes with the polymerase synthesizing pre-mRNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction. As discussed previously, RNA polymerase II transcribes the major share of eukaryotic genes, so this section will focus on how this polymerase accomplishes elongation and termination.</p> <p>Although the enzymatic process of elongation is essentially the same in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the DNA template is more complex. When eukaryotic cells are not dividing, their genes exist as a diffuse mass of DNA and proteins called chromatin. The DNA is tightly packaged around charged histone proteins at repeated intervals. These DNA–histone complexes, collectively called nucleosomes, are regularly spaced and include 146 nucleotides of DNA wound around eight histones like thread around a spool.</p> <p>For polynucleotide synthesis to occur, the transcription machinery needs to move histones out of the way every time it encounters a nucleosome. This is accomplished by a special protein complex called&nbsp;<strong>FACT</strong>, which stands for “facilitates chromatin transcription.” This complex pulls histones away from the DNA template as the polymerase moves along it. Once the pre-mRNA is synthesized, the FACT complex replaces the histones to recreate the nucleosomes.</p> <p>The termination of transcription is different for the different polymerases. Unlike in prokaryotes, elongation by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes takes place 1,000–2,000 nucleotides beyond the end of the gene being transcribed. This pre-mRNA tail is subsequently removed by cleavage during mRNA processing. On the other hand, RNA polymerases I and III require termination signals. Genes transcribed by RNA polymerase I contain a specific 18-nucleotide sequence that is recognized by a termination protein. The process of termination in RNA polymerase III involves an mRNA hairpin similar to rho-independent termination of transcription in prokaryotes.</p> <h2>pre-RNA and mRNA</h2> <p>After transcription, eukaryotic pre-mRNAs must undergo several processing steps before they can be translated. Eukaryotic (and prokaryotic) tRNAs and rRNAs also undergo processing before they can function as components in the protein synthesis machinery.</p> <h3>mRNA Processing</h3> <p>The eukaryotic pre-mRNA undergoes extensive processing before it is ready to be translated. The additional steps involved in eukaryotic mRNA maturation create a molecule with a much longer half-life than a prokaryotic mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNAs last for several hours, whereas the typical&nbsp;<em>E. coli</em> mRNA lasts no more than five seconds.</p> <p>Pre-mRNAs are first coated in RNA-stabilizing proteins; these protect the pre-mRNA from degradation while it is processed and exported out of the nucleus. The three most important steps of pre-mRNA processing are the addition of stabilizing and signaling factors at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the molecule, and the removal of intervening sequences that do not specify the appropriate amino acids. In rare cases, the mRNA transcript can be “edited” after it is transcribed.</p> <h3>5′ Capping</h3> <p>While the pre-mRNA is still being synthesized, a&nbsp;<strong>7-methylguanosine cap</strong> is added to the 5′ end of the growing transcript by a phosphate linkage. This moiety (functional group) protects the nascent mRNA from degradation. In addition, factors involved in protein synthesis recognize the cap to help initiate translation by ribosomes.</p> <h3>3′ Poly-A Tail</h3> <p>Once elongation is complete, the pre-mRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease between an AAUAAA consensus sequence and a GU-rich sequence, leaving the AAUAAA sequence on the pre-mRNA. An enzyme called poly-A polymerase then adds a string of approximately 200 A residues, called the&nbsp;<strong>poly-A tail</strong>. This modification further protects the pre-mRNA from degradation and signals the export of the cellular factors that the transcript needs to the cytoplasm.</p> <h3>Pre-mRNA Splicing</h3> <p>Eukaryotic genes are composed of&nbsp;<strong>exons</strong>, which correspond to protein-coding sequences (<em>ex-</em>on signifies that they are <em>ex</em>pressed), and <em>int</em>ervening sequences called <strong>introns</strong> (<em>int</em>ron denotes their <em>int</em>ervening role), which may be involved in gene regulation but are removed from the pre-mRNA during processing. Intron sequences in mRNA do not encode functional proteins.</p> <p>The discovery of introns came as a surprise to researchers in the 1970s who expected that pre-mRNAs would specify protein sequences without further processing, as they had observed in prokaryotes. The genes of higher eukaryotes very often contain one or more introns. These regions may correspond to regulatory sequences; however, the biological significance of having many introns or having very long introns in a gene is unclear. It is possible that introns slow down gene expression because it takes longer to transcribe pre-mRNAs with lots of introns. Alternatively, introns may be nonfunctional sequence remnants left over from the fusion of ancient genes throughout evolution. This is supported by the fact that separate exons often encode separate protein subunits or domains. For the most part, the sequences of introns can be mutated without ultimately affecting the protein product.</p> <p>All of a pre-mRNA’s introns must be completely and precisely removed before protein synthesis. If the process errs by even a single nucleotide, the reading frame of the rejoined exons would shift, and the resulting protein would be dysfunctional. The process of removing introns and reconnecting exons is called&nbsp;<strong>splicing</strong> (Figure 5). Introns are removed and degraded while the pre-mRNA is still in the nucleus. Splicing occurs by a sequence-specific mechanism that ensures introns will be removed and exons rejoined with the accuracy and precision of a single nucleotide. The splicing of pre-mRNAs is conducted by complexes of proteins and RNA molecules called spliceosomes.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <div id="attachment_4556" style="width: 894px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-4556" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/03/23214857/Figure_15_04_02.jpg" alt="Illustration shows a spliceosome bound to mRNA.

The mRNAs of this pathogen must be modified by the addition of nucleotides before protein synthesis can occur. (credit: modification of work by Torsten Ochsenreiter)</p> </div> <p>The trypanosomes are a group of protozoa that include the pathogen <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em>, which causes sleeping sickness in humans (Figure 6). Trypanosomes, and virtually all other eukaryotes, have organelles called mitochondria that supply the cell with chemical energy. Mitochondria are organelles that express their own DNA and are believed to be the remnants of a symbiotic relationship between a eukaryote and an engulfed prokaryote. The mitochondrial DNA of trypanosomes exhibit an interesting exception to The Central Dogma: their pre-mRNAs do not have the correct information to specify a functional protein. Usually, this is because the mRNA is missing several U nucleotides. The cell performs an additional RNA processing step called RNA editing to remedy this.</p> <p>Other genes in the mitochondrial genome encode 40- to 80-nucleotide guide RNAs. One or more of these molecules interacts by complementary base pairing with some of the nucleotides in the pre-mRNA transcript. However, the guide RNA has more A nucleotides than the pre-mRNA has U nucleotides to bind with. In these regions, the guide RNA loops out. The 3′ ends of guide RNAs have a long poly-U tail, and these U bases are inserted in regions of the pre-mRNA transcript at which the guide RNAs are looped. This process is entirely mediated by RNA molecules. That is, guide RNAs—rather than proteins—serve as the catalysts in RNA editing.</p> <p>RNA editing is not just a phenomenon of trypanosomes. In the mitochondria of some plants, almost all pre-mRNAs are edited. RNA editing has also been identified in mammals such as rats, rabbits, and even humans. What could be the evolutionary reason for this additional step in pre-mRNA processing? One possibility is that the mitochondria, being remnants of ancient prokaryotes, have an equally ancient RNA-based method for regulating gene expression. In support of this hypothesis, edits made to pre-mRNAs differ depending on cellular conditions. Although speculative, the process of RNA editing may be a holdover from a primordial time when RNA molecules, instead of proteins, were responsible for catalyzing reactions.</p> </div> <h2>RNA Post-Translational Modification</h2> <p>The genes that a eukaryotic cell turns “on” largely determine its identity and properties. For instance, a photoreceptor cell in your eye can detect light because it expresses genes for light-sensitive proteins, as well as as genes for neurotransmitters that allow signals to be relayed to the brain.</p> <p>In eukaryotic cells like photoreceptors, gene expression is often controlled primarily at the level of transcription. However, that doesn’t mean transcription is the last chance for regulation. Later stages of gene expression can also be regulated, including the following:</p> <ul><li>RNA processing, such as splicing, capping, and addition of a poly-A tail</li> <li>Messenger RNA (mRNA) translation and lifetime in the cytosol</li> <li>Protein modifications, such as addition of chemical groups or removal of amino acids</li> </ul> <p>In the sections below, we’ll discuss some common types of gene regulation that occur after an RNA transcript has been made.</p> <h3>Regulation of RNA processing</h3> <p>When a eukaryotic gene is transcribed in the nucleus, the primary transcript (freshly made RNA molecule) isn’t yet considered a messenger RNA. Instead, it’s an “immature” molecule called a pre-mRNA.</p> <p>The pre-mRNA has to go through some modifications to become a mature mRNA molecule that can leave the nucleus and be translated. These include splicing, capping, and addition of a poly-A tail, all of which can potentially be regulated – sped up, slowed down, or altered to result in a different product.</p> <h4>Alternative splicing</h4> <p>Most pre-mRNA molecules have sections that are removed from the molecule, called <strong>introns</strong>, and sections that are linked or together to make the final mRNA, called <strong>exons</strong>. This process is called <strong>splicing</strong>.</p> <p>In the process of <strong>alternative splicing</strong>, different portions of an mRNA can be selected for use as exons. This allows either of two (or more) mRNA molecules to be made from one pre-mRNA.</p> <div id="attachment_4193" style="width: 556px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-4193" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/25200449/splice.jpg" alt="Diagram of a pre-mRNA being spliced into two different variants.

Image modified from “Eukaryotic Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation,” by OpenStax College, Biology (CC BY 3.0).</p> </div> <p>Alternative splicing is not a random process. Instead, it’s typically controlled by regulatory proteins. The proteins bind to specific sites on the pre-mRNA and “tell” the splicing factors which exons should be used. Different cell types may express different regulatory proteins, so different exon combinations can be used in each cell type, leading to the production of different proteins.</p> <h3>Small regulatory RNA</h3> <p>Once an mRNA has left the nucleus, it may or may not be translated many times to make proteins. Two key determinants of how much protein is made from an mRNA are its “lifespan” (how long it floats around in the cytosol) and how readily the translation machinery, such as the ribosome, can attach to it.</p> <p>A recently discovered class of regulators, called small regulatory RNAs, can control mRNA lifespan and translation. Let’s see how this works.</p> <h4>microRNAs</h4> <p><strong>microRNAs (miRNAs)</strong> were among the first small regulatory RNAs to be discovered. A miRNA is first transcribed as a long RNA molecule, which forms base pairs with itself and folds over to make a hairpin. Next, the hairpin is chopped up by enzymes, releasing a small double-stranded fragment of about 20&nbsp;nucleotides. One of the strands in this fragment is the mature miRNA, which binds to a specific protein to make an RNA-protein complex.</p> <div id="attachment_2702" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2702" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/13154653/microRNA-1024x951.png" alt="Diagram of where miRNAs come from and and how they regulate targets.

One strand of this duplex is the miRNA, which associates with a protein to form a microRNA-protein complex. The miRNA directs the protein complex to mRNAs that are partially or fully complementary to the miRNA. When the miRNA is perfectly complementary to the mRNA, the mRNA is often cut in two by an enzyme in the protein complex. When the miRNA is not perfectly complementary to the mRNA, the miRNA complex may remain bound to the mRNA and block translation." width="600" height="557" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/13154653/microRNA-1024x951.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/13154653/microRNA-300x279.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/13154653/microRNA-768x713.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/13154653/microRNA-65x60.png 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/13154653/microRNA-225x209.png 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/13154653/microRNA-350x325.png 350w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/13154653/microRNA.png 1600w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 8.

The process of translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we’ll explore how translation occurs in&nbsp;<em>E. coli</em>, a representative prokaryote, and specify any differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.</p> <h3>Initiation of Translation</h3> <p>Protein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex. In&nbsp;<em>E. coli</em>, this complex involves the small 30S ribosome, the mRNA template, three initiation factors (IFs; IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3), and a special <strong>initiator tRNA</strong>, called [latex]\text{tRNA}^{Met}_{f}[/latex]. The initiator tRNA interacts with the start codon AUG (or rarely, GUG), links to a formylated methionine called fMet, and can also bind IF-2. Formylated methionine is inserted by&nbsp;[latex] \text{fMet} - \text{tRNA}^{\text {Met}}_{\text f}[/latex]&nbsp; at the beginning of every polypeptide chain synthesized by <em>E. coli</em>, but it is usually clipped off after translation is complete. When an in-frame AUG is encountered during translation elongation, a non-formylated methionine is inserted by a regular Met-tRNA<sup>Met</sup>.</p> <p>In&nbsp;<em>E. coli</em> mRNA, a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon, called the <strong>Shine-Dalgarno sequence</strong> (AGGAGG), interacts with the rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome. This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mRNA template. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is a purine nucleotide triphosphate, acts as an energy source during translation—both at the start of elongation and during the ribosome’s translocation.</p> <p>In eukaryotes, a similar initiation complex forms, comprising mRNA, the 40S small ribosomal subunit, IFs, and nucleoside triphosphates (GTP and ATP). The charged initiator tRNA, called Met-tRNAi, does not bind fMet in eukaryotes, but is distinct from other Met-tRNAs in that it can bind IFs.</p> <p>Instead of depositing at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5′ end of the mRNA. A cap-binding protein (CBP) and several other IFs assist the movement of the ribosome to the 5′ cap. Once at the cap, the initiation complex tracks along the mRNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction, searching for the AUG start codon. Many eukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first AUG, but this is not always the case. According to&nbsp;<strong>Kozak’s rules</strong>, the nucleotides around the AUG indicate whether it is the correct start codon. Kozak’s rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear around the AUG of vertebrate genes: 5′-gccRccAUGG-3′. The R (for purine) indicates a site that can be either A or G, but cannot be C or U. Essentially, the closer the sequence is to this consensus, the higher the efficiency of translation.</p> <p>Once the appropriate AUG is identified, the other proteins and CBP dissociate, and the 60S subunit binds to the complex of Met-tRNAi, mRNA, and the 40S subunit. This step completes the initiation of translation in eukaryotes.</p> <h3>Translation, Elongation, and Termination</h3> <p>In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the basics of elongation are the same, so we will review elongation from the perspective of&nbsp;<em>E. coli</em>. The 50S ribosomal subunit of <em>E. coli </em>consists of three compartments: the A (aminoacyl) site binds incoming charged aminoacyl tRNAs. The P (peptidyl) site binds charged tRNAs carrying amino acids that have formed peptide bonds with the growing polypeptide chain but have not yet dissociated from their corresponding tRNA. The E (exit) site releases dissociated tRNAs so that they can be recharged with free amino acids. There is one exception to this assembly line of tRNAs: in <em>E. coli</em>, [latex]\text{fMet}-\text{tRNA}^{\text {Met}}_{\text f}[/latex]&nbsp;is capable of entering the P site directly without first entering the A site. Similarly, the eukaryotic Met-tRNAi, with help from other proteins of the initiation complex, binds directly to the P site (Figure 1). In both cases, this creates an initiation complex with a free A site ready to accept the tRNA corresponding to the first codon after the AUG.</p> <div id="attachment_1461" style="width: 661px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1461" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191344/651px-Ribosome_mRNA_translation_en.svg_.png" alt="Diagram showing how the translation of the mRNA and the synthesis of proteins is made" width="651" height="459" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191344/651px-Ribosome_mRNA_translation_en.svg_.png 651w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191344/651px-Ribosome_mRNA_translation_en.svg_-300x212.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191344/651px-Ribosome_mRNA_translation_en.svg_-65x46.png 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191344/651px-Ribosome_mRNA_translation_en.svg_-225x159.png 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191344/651px-Ribosome_mRNA_translation_en.svg_-350x247.png 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1. Ribosome mRNA translation</p> </div> <p>During translation elongation, the mRNA template provides specificity. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, each mRNA codon comes into register, and specific binding with the corresponding charged tRNA anticodon is ensured. If mRNA were not present in the elongation complex, the ribosome would bind tRNAs nonspecifically.</p> <p>Elongation proceeds with charged tRNAs entering the A site and then shifting to the P site followed by the E site with each single-codon “step” of the ribosome. Ribosomal steps are induced by conformational changes that advance the ribosome by three bases in the 3′ direction. The energy for each step of the ribosome is donated by an elongation factor that hydrolyzes GTP. Peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the A-site tRNA and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the P-site tRNA. The formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by&nbsp;<strong>peptidyl transferase</strong>, an RNA-based enzyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit. The energy for each peptide bond formation is derived from GTP hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by a separate elongation factor. The amino acid bound to the P-site tRNA is also linked to the growing polypeptide chain. As the ribosome steps across the mRNA, the former P-site tRNA enters the E site, detaches from the amino acid, and is expelled (Figure&nbsp;2). Amazingly, the <em>E. coli </em>translation apparatus takes only 0.05 seconds to add each amino acid, meaning that a 200-amino acid protein can be translated in just 10 seconds.</p> <div id="attachment_1462" style="width: 479px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1462" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191509/Figure_15_05_02.png" alt="Illustration shows the steps of protein synthesis.

Upon aligning with the A site, these nonsense codons are recognized by release factors in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that instruct peptidyl transferase to add a water molecule to the carboxyl end of the P-site amino acid. This reaction forces the P-site amino acid to detach from its tRNA, and the newly made protein is released. The small and large ribosomal subunits dissociate from the mRNA and from each other; they are recruited almost immediately into another translation initiation complex. After many ribosomes have completed translation, the mRNA is degraded so the nucleotides can be reused in another transcription reaction.</p> <h2>Processing of tRNAs and rRNAs</h2> <div id="attachment_1457" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1457" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02190850/Figure_15_04_03.jpg" alt="The molecular model of phenylalanine tRNA is L-shaped.

In turn, proteins account for more mass than any other component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and proteins perform virtually every function of a cell. The process of translation, or protein synthesis, involves the decoding of an mRNA message into a polypeptide product. Amino acids are covalently strung together by interlinking peptide bonds in lengths ranging from approximately 50 amino acid residues to more than 1,000. Each individual amino acid has an amino group (NH<sub>2</sub>) and a carboxyl (COOH) group. Polypeptides are formed when the amino group of one amino acid forms an amide (i.e., peptide) bond with the carboxyl group of another amino acid (Figure 4). This reaction is catalyzed by ribosomes and generates one water molecule.</p> <h3>The Protein Synthesis Machinery</h3> <p>In addition to the mRNA template, many molecules and macromolecules contribute to the process of translation. The composition of each component may vary across species; for instance, ribosomes may consist of different numbers of rRNAs and polypeptides depending on the organism. However, the general structures and functions of the protein synthesis machinery are comparable from bacteria to human cells. Translation requires the input of an mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/tryit/dna/protein.html" target="_blank">Click through the steps of this&nbsp;PBS interactive to see protein synthesis in action.</a></div> <h4>Ribosomes</h4> <p>Even before an mRNA is translated, a cell must invest energy to build each of its ribosomes. In&nbsp;<em>E. coli</em>, there are between 10,000 and 70,000 ribosomes present in each cell at any given time. A ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of structural and catalytic rRNAs, and many distinct polypeptides. In eukaryotes, the nucleolus is completely specialized for the synthesis and assembly of rRNAs.</p> <p>Ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and rough endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes. Mitochondria and chloroplasts also have their own ribosomes in the matrix and stroma, which look more similar to prokaryotic ribosomes (and have similar drug sensitivities) than the ribosomes just outside their outer membranes in the cytoplasm. Ribosomes dissociate into large and small subunits when they are not synthesizing proteins and reassociate during the initiation of translation. In&nbsp;<em>E. coli</em>, the small subunit is described as 30S, and the large subunit is 50S, for a total of 70S (recall that Svedberg units are not additive). Mammalian ribosomes have a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit, for a total of 80S. The small subunit is responsible for binding the mRNA template, whereas the large subunit sequentially binds tRNAs. Each mRNA molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes, all synthesizing protein in the same direction: reading the mRNA from 5′ to 3′ and synthesizing the polypeptide from the N terminus to the C terminus. The complete mRNA/poly-ribosome structure is called a <strong>polysome</strong>.</p> <h4>tRNAs</h4> <p>The tRNAs are structural RNA molecules that were transcribed from genes by RNA polymerase III. Depending on the species, 40 to 60 types of tRNAs exist in the cytoplasm. Serving as adaptors, specific tRNAs bind to sequences on the mRNA template and add the corresponding amino acid to the polypeptide chain. Therefore, tRNAs are the molecules that actually “translate” the language of RNA into the language of proteins.</p> <p>Of the 64 possible mRNA codons—or triplet combinations of A, U, G, and C—three specify the termination of protein synthesis and 61 specify the addition of amino acids to the polypeptide chain. Of these 61, one codon (AUG) also encodes the initiation of translation. Each tRNA anticodon can base pair with one of the mRNA codons and add an amino acid or terminate translation, according to the genetic code. For instance, if the sequence CUA occurred on an mRNA template in the proper reading frame, it would bind a tRNA expressing the complementary sequence, GAU, which would be linked to the amino acid leucine.</p> <p>As the adaptor molecules of translation, it is surprising that tRNAs can fit so much specificity into such a small package. Consider that tRNAs need to interact with three factors:</p> <ol><li>They must be recognized by the correct aminoacyl synthetase.</li> <li>They must be recognized by ribosomes.</li> <li>They must bind to the correct sequence in mRNA.</li> </ol> <h4>Aminoacyl tRNA Synthetases</h4> <p>The process of pre-tRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase III only creates the RNA portion of the adaptor molecule. The corresponding amino acid must be added later, once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm. Through the process of tRNA “charging,” each tRNA molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. At least one type of&nbsp;<strong>aminoacyl tRNA synthetase</strong> exists for each of the 20 amino acids; the exact number of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases varies by species. These enzymes first bind and hydrolyze ATP to catalyze a high-energy bond between an amino acid and adenosine monophosphate (AMP); a pyrophosphate molecule is expelled in this reaction. The activated amino acid is then transferred to the tRNA, and AMP is released.</p> <h2>Codons</h2> <p>Given the different numbers of “letters” in the mRNA and protein “alphabets,” scientists theorized that combinations of nucleotides corresponded to single amino acids. Nucleotide doublets would not be sufficient to specify every amino acid because there are only 16 possible two-nucleotide combinations (42). In contrast, there are 64 possible nucleotide triplets (43), which is far more than the number of amino acids. Scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide triplets and that the genetic code was&nbsp;<strong>degenerate</strong>. In other words, a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet. This was later confirmed experimentally; Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner used the chemical mutagen proflavin to insert one, two, or three nucleotides into the gene of a virus. When one or two nucleotides were inserted, protein synthesis was completely abolished. When three nucleotides were inserted, the protein was synthesized and functional. This demonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid. These nucleotide triplets are called <strong>codons</strong>. The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame, thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid (Figure 5). Though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation, the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained.</p> <div id="attachment_1445" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1445" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02185816/Figure_15_01_05.jpg" alt="Illustration shows a frameshift mutation in which the reading frame is altered by the deletion of two amino acids." width="544" height="120" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02185816/Figure_15_01_05.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02185816/Figure_15_01_05-300x66.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02185816/Figure_15_01_05-65x14.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02185816/Figure_15_01_05-225x50.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02185816/Figure_15_01_05-350x77.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 5.

This figure shows the genetic code for translating each nucleotide triplet in mRNA into an amino acid or a termination signal in a nascent protein. (credit: modification of work by NIH)</p> </div> <p>In addition to instructing the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain, three of the 64 codons terminate protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery. These triplets are called nonsense codons, or stop codons. Another codon, AUG, also has a special function. In addition to specifying the amino acid methionine, it also serves as the start codon to initiate translation. The reading frame for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5′ end of the mRNA.</p> <p>The genetic code is universal. With a few exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis. Conservation of codons means that a purified mRNA encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. That there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on Earth shares a common origin, especially considering that there are about 1084 possible combinations of 20 amino acids and 64 triplet codons.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">Transcribe a gene and translate it to protein using complementary pairing and the genetic code at this&nbsp;<a href="http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/molecules/transcribe/" target="_blank">site</a>.</div> <p>Degeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations. Codons that specify the same amino acid typically only differ by one nucleotide. In addition, amino acids with chemically similar side chains are encoded by similar codons. This nuance of the genetic code ensures that a single-nucleotide substitution mutation might either specify the same amino acid but have no effect or specify a similar amino acid, preventing the protein from being rendered completely nonfunctional.</p> <h2>Protein Modifications</h2> <p>During and after translation, individual amino acids may be chemically modified, signal sequences may be appended, and the new protein “folds” into a distinct three-dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions. A&nbsp;<strong>signal sequence</strong> is a short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment. These sequences at the amino end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the protein’s “train ticket” to its ultimate destination. Other cellular factors recognize each signal sequence and help transport the protein from the cytoplasm to its correct compartment. For instance, a specific sequence at the amino terminus will direct a protein to the mitochondria or chloroplasts (in plants). Once the protein reaches its cellular destination, the signal sequence is usually clipped off.</p> <p>Many proteins fold spontaneously, but some proteins require helper molecules, called chaperones, to prevent them from aggregating during the complicated process of folding. Even if a protein is properly specified by its corresponding mRNA, it could take on a completely dysfunctional shape if abnormal temperature or pH conditions prevent it from folding correctly.</p> <h3>Chemical Modifications, Protein Activity, and Longevity</h3> <p>Proteins can be chemically modified with the addition of groups including methyl, phosphate, acetyl, and ubiquitin groups. The addition or removal of these groups from proteins regulates their activity or the length of time they exist in the cell. Sometimes these modifications can regulate where a protein is found in the cell—for example, in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, or attached to the plasma membrane.</p> <p>Chemical modifications occur in response to external stimuli such as stress, the lack of nutrients, heat, or ultraviolet light exposure. These changes can alter epigenetic accessibility, transcription, mRNA stability, or translation—all resulting in changes in expression of various genes. This is an efficient way for the cell to rapidly change the levels of specific proteins in response to the environment. Because proteins are involved in every stage of gene regulation, the phosphorylation of a protein (depending on the protein that is modified) can alter accessibility to the chromosome, can alter translation (by altering transcription factor binding or function), can change nuclear shuttling (by influencing modifications to the nuclear pore complex), can alter RNA stability (by binding or not binding to the RNA to regulate its stability), can modify translation (increase or decrease), or can change post-translational modifications (add or remove phosphates or other chemical modifications).</p> <p>The addition of an ubiquitin group to a protein marks that protein for degradation. Ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the protein lifespan is complete. These proteins are moved to the <strong>proteasome</strong>, an organelle that functions to remove proteins, to be degraded (Figure 7). One way to control gene expression, therefore, is to alter the longevity of the protein.</p> <div id="attachment_4099" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-4099" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/09233500/Figure_16_06_02.jpg" alt="Multiple ubiquitin groups bind to a protein.

A bacterial chromosome is a covalently closed circle that, unlike eukaryotic chromosomes, is not organized around histone proteins. The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the nucleoid. In addition, prokaryotes often have abundant <strong>plasmids</strong>, which are shorter circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes. Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance. Because of these unique features, transcription and gene regulation is somewhat different between prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic ones.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>Learning Objectives</h3> <ul><li>Understand the basic steps in the transcription of DNA into RNA in prokaryotic cells</li> <li>Understand the basics of prokaryotic translation and how it differs from eukaryotic translation</li> </ul> </div> <h2>Prokaryotic Transcription</h2> <h3>Initiation of Transcription in Prokaryotes</h3> <p>Prokaryotes do not have membrane-enclosed nuclei. Therefore, the processes of transcription, translation, and mRNA degradation can all occur simultaneously. The intracellular level of a bacterial protein can quickly be amplified by multiple transcription and translation events occurring concurrently on the same DNA template. Prokaryotic transcription often covers more than one gene and produces polycistronic mRNAs that specify more than one protein.</p> <p>Our discussion here will exemplify transcription by describing this process in <em>Escherichia coli</em>, a well-studied bacterial species. Although some differences exist between transcription in <em>E. coli</em> and transcription in archaea, an understanding of <em>E. coli </em>transcription can be applied to virtually all bacterial species.</p> <h4>Prokaryotic RNA Polymerase</h4> <p>Prokaryotes use the same RNA polymerase to transcribe all of their genes. In <em>E. coli</em>, the polymerase is composed of five polypeptide subunits, two of which are identical. Four of these subunits, denoted <em>α</em>, <em>α</em>, <em>β</em>, and <em>β</em>′ comprise the polymerase <strong>core enzyme</strong>. These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed, and they disassemble once transcription is complete. Each subunit has a unique role; the two <em>α</em>-subunits are necessary to assemble the polymerase on the DNA; the <em>β</em>-subunit binds to the ribonucleoside triphosphate that will become part of the nascent “recently born” mRNA molecule; and the <em>β</em>′ binds the DNA template strand. The fifth subunit, <em>σ</em>, is involved only in transcription initiation. It confers transcriptional specificity such that the polymerase begins to synthesize mRNA from an appropriate initiation site. Without <em>σ</em>, the core enzyme would transcribe from random sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein gibberish. The polymerase comprised of all five subunits is called the <strong>holoenzyme</strong>.</p> <h4>Prokaryotic Promoters</h4> <div id="attachment_4028" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-4028" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/04050852/Figure_15_02_01.jpg" alt="Illustration shows the σ subunit of RNA polymerase bound to two consensus sequences that are 10 and 35 bases upstream of the transcription start site.

The σ subunit of prokaryotic RNA polymerase recognizes consensus sequences found in the promoter region upstream of the transcription start sight. The σ subunit dissociates from the polymerase after transcription has been initiated.</p> </div> <p>A <strong>promoter</strong> is a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery binds and initiates transcription. In most cases, promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate. The specific sequence of a promoter is very important because it determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all the time, some of the time, or infrequently. Although promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes, a few elements are conserved. At the -10 and -35 regions upstream of the initiation site, there are two promoter <strong>consensus&nbsp;</strong>sequences, or regions that are similar across all promoters and across various bacterial species (Figure 1).</p> <p>The -10 consensus sequence, called the -10 region, is TATAAT. The -35 sequence, TTGACA, is recognized and bound by <em>σ</em>. Once this interaction is made, the subunits of the core enzyme bind to the site. The A–T-rich -10 region facilitates unwinding of the DNA template, and several phosphodiester bonds are made. The transcription initiation phase ends with the production of abortive transcripts, which are polymers of approximately 10 nucleotides that are made and released.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">View this <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/transcription" target="_window" rel="nofollow">MolecularMovies animation</a> to see the first part of transcription and the base sequence repetition of the TATA box.</div> <h3>Elongation and Termination in Prokaryotes</h3> <p>The transcription elongation phase begins with the release of the <em>σ</em> subunit from the polymerase. The dissociation of <em>σ</em> allows the core enzyme to proceed along the DNA template, synthesizing mRNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction at a rate of approximately 40 nucleotides per second. As elongation proceeds, the DNA is continuously unwound ahead of the core enzyme and rewound behind it (Figure 2). The base pairing between DNA and RNA is not stable enough to maintain the stability of the mRNA synthesis components. Instead, the RNA polymerase acts as a stable linker between the DNA template and the nascent RNA strands to ensure that elongation is not interrupted prematurely.</p> <div id="attachment_4182" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-4182 size-large" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/25191457/Figure_15_01_02a-1024x205.jpg" alt="To make a protein, genetic information encoded by the DNA must be transcribed onto an mRNA molecule.

Click for a larger image. During elongation, the prokaryotic RNA polymerase tracks along the DNA template, synthesizes mRNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction, and unwinds and rewinds the DNA as it is read.</p> </div> <h3>Prokaryotic Termination Signals</h3> <p>Once a gene is transcribed, the prokaryotic polymerase needs to be instructed to dissociate from the DNA template and liberate the newly made mRNA. Depending on the gene being transcribed, there are two kinds of termination signals. One is protein-based and the other is RNA-based. <strong>Rho-dependent termination</strong> is controlled by the rho protein, which tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing mRNA chain. Near the end of the gene, the polymerase encounters a run of G nucleotides on the DNA template and it stalls. As a result, the rho protein collides with the polymerase. The interaction with rho releases the mRNA from the transcription bubble.</p> <p><strong>Rho-independent termination</strong> is controlled by specific sequences in the DNA template strand. As the polymerase nears the end of the gene being transcribed, it encounters a region rich in C–G nucleotides. The mRNA folds back on itself, and the complementary C–G nucleotides bind together. The result is a stable <strong>hairpin</strong> that causes the polymerase to stall as soon as it begins to transcribe a region rich in A–T nucleotides. The complementary U–A region of the mRNA transcript forms only a weak interaction with the template DNA. This, coupled with the stalled polymerase, induces enough instability for the core enzyme to break away and liberate the new mRNA transcript.</p> <p>Upon termination, the process of transcription is complete. By the time termination occurs, the prokaryotic transcript would already have been used to begin synthesis of numerous copies of the encoded protein because these processes can occur concurrently. The unification of transcription, translation, and even mRNA degradation is possible because all of these processes occur in the same 5′ to 3′ direction, and because there is no membranous compartmentalization in the prokaryotic cell (Figure 3). In contrast, the presence of a nucleus in eukaryotic cells precludes simultaneous transcription and translation.</p> <div id="attachment_4030" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-4030" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/04051219/Figure_15_02_03.jpg" alt="Illustration shows multiple mRNAs transcribed off one gene.

Here we will explore how translation occurs in <em>E. coli</em>, a representative prokaryote, and specify any differences between bacterial and eukaryotic translation.</p> <h3>Initiation</h3> <p>The <strong>initiation of protein synthesis</strong> begins with the formation of an initiation complex. In <em><strong>E. coli</strong></em>, this complex involves the small 30S ribosome, the mRNA template, three initiation factors that help the ribosome assemble correctly, guanosine triphosphate (GTP) that acts as an energy source, and a special initiator tRNA carrying <strong><em>N</em>-formyl-methionine</strong> (fMet-tRNAf<sup>Met</sup>) (Figure 4). The initiator tRNA interacts with the start codon AUG of the mRNA and carries a formylated methionine (fMet). Because of its involvement in initiation, fMet is inserted at the beginning (N terminus) of every polypeptide chain synthesized by <em>E. coli</em>. In <em>E. coli</em> mRNA, a leader sequence upstream of the first AUG codon, called the <strong>Shine-Dalgarno sequence</strong> (also known as the ribosomal binding site AGGAGG), interacts through complementary base pairing with the rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome. This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mRNA template. At this point, the 50S ribosomal subunit then binds to the initiation complex, forming an intact ribosome.</p> <p>In eukaryotes, initiation complex formation is similar, with the following differences:</p> <ul><li>The initiator tRNA is a different specialized tRNA carrying methionine, called Met-tRNAi</li> <li>Instead of binding to the mRNA at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 5′ cap of the eukaryotic mRNA, then tracks along the mRNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction until the AUG start codon is recognized.

Translation in bacteria begins with the formation of the initiation complex, which includes the small ribosomal subunit, the mRNA, the initiator tRNA carrying N-formyl-methionine, and initiation factors. Then the 50S subunit binds, forming an intact ribosome.</p> </div> <h3>Elongation</h3> <p>In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the basics of <strong>elongation of translation</strong> are the same. In <strong><em>E. coli</em></strong>, the binding of the 50S ribosomal subunit to produce the intact ribosome forms three functionally important ribosomal sites: The <strong>A (aminoacyl) site</strong> binds incoming charged aminoacyl tRNAs. The <strong>P (peptidyl) site</strong> binds charged tRNAs carrying amino acids that have formed peptide bonds with the growing polypeptide chain but have not yet dissociated from their corresponding tRNA. The <strong>E (exit) site</strong> releases dissociated tRNAs so that they can be recharged with free amino acids. There is one notable exception to this assembly line of tRNAs: During initiation complex formation, bacterial fMet−tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> or eukaryotic Met-tRNAi enters the P site directly without first entering the A site, providing a free A site ready to accept the tRNA corresponding to the first codon after the AUG.</p> <p>Elongation proceeds with single-codon movements of the ribosome each called a translocation event. During each translocation event, the charged tRNAs enter at the A site, then shift to the P site, and then finally to the E site for removal. Ribosomal movements, or steps, are induced by conformational changes that advance the ribosome by three bases in the 3′ direction. Peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the A-site tRNA and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the P-site tRNA. The formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by <strong>peptidyl transferase</strong>, an RNA-based ribozyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit. The amino acid bound to the P-site tRNA is also linked to the growing polypeptide chain. As the ribosome steps across the mRNA, the former P-site tRNA enters the E site, detaches from the amino acid, and is expelled. Several of the steps during elongation, including binding of a charged aminoacyl tRNA to the A site and translocation, require energy derived from GTP hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by specific elongation factors. Amazingly, the <em>E. coli</em> translation apparatus takes only 0.05 seconds to add each amino acid, meaning that a 200 amino-acid protein can be translated in just 10 seconds.</p> <h3>Termination</h3> <p>The <strong>termination of translation</strong> occurs when a <strong>nonsense codon</strong> (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered for which there is no complementary tRNA. On aligning with the A site, these nonsense codons are recognized by release factors in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that result in the P-site amino acid detaching from its tRNA, releasing the newly made polypeptide. The small and large ribosomal subunits dissociate from the mRNA and from each other; they are recruited almost immediately into another translation init iation complex.</p> <p>In summary, there are several key features that distinguish prokaryotic gene expression from that seen in eukaryotes. These are illustrated in Figure 5&nbsp;and listed in Table 1.</p> <div id="attachment_4079" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-4079" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/05233214/OSC_Microbio_11_04_ProkEuk-1024x519.jpg" alt="a) Diagram of prokaryotic cell with a plasma membrane on the outside.

Mutations can also alter the growth rate or the progression of the cell through the cell cycle.</p> <p>Thus, cancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression. Changes at every level of eukaryotic gene expression can be detected in some form of cancer at some point in time. In order to understand how changes to gene expression can cause cancer, it is critical to understand how each stage of gene regulation works in normal cells.

Thanks to gene regulation, each cell type in your body has a different set of active genes—despite the fact that almost all the cells of your body contain the exact same DNA. These different patterns of gene expression cause your various cell types to have different sets of proteins, making each cell type uniquely specialized to do its job.</p> <p>For example, one of the jobs of the liver is to remove toxic substances like alcohol from the bloodstream. To do this, liver cells express genes encoding subunits (pieces) of an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase. This enzyme breaks alcohol down into a non-toxic molecule. The neurons in a person’s brain don’t remove toxins from the body, so they keep these genes unexpressed, or “turned off.” Similarly, the cells of the liver don’t send signals using neurotransmitters, so they keep neurotransmitter genes turned off (Figure 1).</p> <div id="attachment_4072" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-4072" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/05204340/genes-1024x767.png" alt="Left panel: Liver cell.

San Francisco, CA: Pearson.</p> </div> </div> <h2>Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Gene Regulation</h2> <p>To understand how gene expression is regulated, we must first understand how a gene codes for a functional protein in a cell. The process occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, just in slightly different manners.</p> <p>Prokaryotic organisms are single-celled organisms that lack a cell nucleus, and their DNA therefore floats freely in the cell cytoplasm. To synthesize a protein, the processes of transcription and translation occur almost simultaneously. When the resulting protein is no longer needed, transcription stops. As a result, the primary method to control what type of protein and how much of each protein is expressed in a prokaryotic cell is the regulation of DNA transcription. All of the subsequent steps occur automatically. When more protein is required, more transcription occurs. Therefore, in prokaryotic cells, the control of gene expression is mostly at the transcriptional level.</p> <p>Eukaryotic cells, in contrast, have intracellular organelles that add to their complexity. In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is contained inside the cell’s nucleus and there it is transcribed into RNA. The newly synthesized RNA is then transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate the RNA into protein. The processes of transcription and translation are physically separated by the nuclear membrane; transcription occurs only within the nucleus, and translation occurs only outside the nucleus in the cytoplasm. The regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process (Figure 1). Regulation may occur when the DNA is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors (<strong>epigenetic</strong> level), when the RNA is transcribed (transcriptional level), when the RNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed (<strong>post-transcriptional</strong> level), when the RNA is translated into protein (translational level), or after the protein has been made (<strong>post-translational</strong> level).</p> <div id="attachment_3882" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-3882" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/12210316/Figure_16_01_01-1024x434.jpg" alt="Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus, and DNA is located in the cytoplasm.

After being transcribed, pre-mRNA is processed in the nucleus to make the mature mRNA, which is then exported to the cytoplasm where ribosomes become associated with it and translation begins." width="1024" height="434" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/12210316/Figure_16_01_01-1024x434.jpg 1024w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/12210316/Figure_16_01_01-300x127.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/12210316/Figure_16_01_01-768x325.jpg 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/12210316/Figure_16_01_01-65x28.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/12210316/Figure_16_01_01-225x95.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/12210316/Figure_16_01_01-350x148.jpg 350w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/12210316/Figure_16_01_01.jpg 1117w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1.

As eukaryotic cells evolved, the complexity of the control of gene expression increased. For example, with the evolution of eukaryotic cells came compartmentalization of important cellular components and cellular processes. A nuclear region that contains the DNA was formed. Transcription and translation were physically separated into two different cellular compartments. It therefore became possible to control gene expression by regulating transcription in the nucleus, and also by controlling the RNA levels and protein translation present outside the nucleus.</p> <p>Some cellular processes arose from the need of the organism to defend itself. Cellular processes such as gene silencing developed to protect the cell from viral or parasitic infections. If the cell could quickly shut off gene expression for a short period of time, it would be able to survive an infection when other organisms could not. Therefore, the organism evolved a new process that helped it survive, and it was able to pass this new development to offspring.</p> </div> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Questions</h3> <p>Control of gene expression in eukaryotic cells occurs at which level(s)?</p> <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>only the transcriptional level</li> <li>epigenetic and transcriptional levels</li> <li>epigenetic, transcriptional, and translational levels</li> <li>epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels</li> </ol> <div class="qa-wrapper" style="display: block"><span class="show-answer collapsed" style="cursor: pointer" data-target="q386227">Show Answer</span> <div id="q386227" class="hidden-answer" style="display: none">Answer d.

In prokaryotes, structural genes of related function are often organized together on the genome and transcribed together under the control of a single promoter. The operon’s regulatory region includes both the promoter and the operator. If a repressor binds to the operator, then the structural genes will not be transcribed. Alternatively, activators may bind to the regulatory region, enhancing transcription.</p> </div> <p>French scientists François <strong>Jacob&nbsp;</strong>(1920–2013) and Jacques <strong>Monod</strong> at the Pasteur Institute were the first to show the organization of bacterial genes into operons, through their studies on the <strong><em data-effect="italics">lac</em> operon</strong> of <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em>. They found that in <em data-effect="italics">E. coli</em>, all of the structural genes that encode enzymes needed to use lactose as an energy source lie next to each other in the lactose (or <em data-effect="italics">lac</em>) operon under the control of a single promoter, the <em data-effect="italics">lac</em> promoter. For this work, they won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1965.</p> <p>Although eukaryotic genes are not organized into operons, prokaryotic operons are excellent models for learning about gene regulation generally. There are some gene clusters in eukaryotes that function similar to operons. Many of the principles can be applied to eukaryotic systems and contribute to our understanding of changes in gene expression in eukaryotes that can result pathological changes such as cancer.</p> <p>Each operon includes DNA sequences that influence its own transcription; these are located in a region called the regulatory region. The regulatory region includes the promoter and the region surrounding the promoter, to which <strong>transcription factors</strong>, proteins encoded by regulatory genes, can bind. Transcription factors influence the binding of <strong>RNA polymerase</strong> to the promoter and allow its progression to transcribe structural genes. A <strong>repressor</strong> is a transcription factor that suppresses transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus by binding to a DNA sequence within the regulatory region called the <strong>operator</strong>, which is located between the RNA polymerase binding site of the promoter and the transcriptional start site of the first structural gene. Repressor binding physically blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing structural genes. Conversely, an <strong>activator</strong> is a transcription factor that increases the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus by facilitating RNA polymerase binding to the promoter. An <strong>inducer</strong>, a third type of regulatory molecule, is a small molecule that either activates or represses transcription by interacting with a repressor or an activator.</p> <p>In prokaryotes, there are examples of operons whose gene products are required rather consistently and whose expression, therefore, is unregulated. Such operons are <strong>constitutively expressed</strong>, meaning they are transcribed and translated continuously to provide the cell with constant intermediate levels of the protein products. Such genes encode enzymes involved in housekeeping functions required for cellular maintenance, including DNA replication, repair, and expression, as well as enzymes involved in core metabolism. In contrast, there are other prokaryotic operons that are expressed only when needed and are regulated by repressors, activators, and inducers.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Questions</h3> <p>What are the parts in the DNA sequence of an operon?</p> <p><textarea rows="2" cols="50"></textarea></p>

The five genes that are needed to synthesize tryptophan in <em>E. coli</em> are located next to each other in the <em>trp</em> operon.

When tryptophan is absent, the repressor protein does not bind to the operator and the genes are transcribed.</p> </div> <p>A DNA sequence that codes for proteins is referred to as the coding region. The five coding regions for the tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes are arranged sequentially on the chromosome in the operon. Just before the coding region is the <strong>transcriptional start site</strong>. This is the region of DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription. The promoter sequence is upstream of the transcriptional start site; each operon has a sequence within or near the promoter to which proteins (activators or repressors) can bind and regulate transcription.</p> <p>A DNA sequence called the operator sequence is encoded between the promoter region and the first <em>trp</em> coding gene. This <strong>operator&nbsp;</strong>contains the DNA code to which the repressor protein can bind. When tryptophan is present in the cell, two tryptophan molecules bind to the <em>trp</em> repressor, which changes shape to bind to the <em>trp</em> operator. Binding of the tryptophan–repressor complex at the operator physically prevents the RNA polymerase from binding, and transcribing the downstream genes.</p> <p>When tryptophan is not present in the cell, the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator; therefore, the operon is active and tryptophan is synthesized.

For example, when glucose is scarce, <em>E. coli</em> bacteria can turn to other sugar sources for fuel. To do this, new genes to process these alternate genes must be transcribed. When glucose levels drop, cyclic AMP (cAMP) begins to accumulate in the cell. The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose and energy metabolism in <em>E. coli</em>. When glucose levels decline in the cell, accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator <strong>catabolite activator protein (CAP)</strong>, a protein that binds to the promoters of operons that control the processing of alternative sugars. When cAMP binds to CAP, the complex binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources (Figure 1). In these operons, a CAP binding site is located upstream of the RNA polymerase binding site in the promoter. This increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and the transcription of the genes.</p> <div id="attachment_3558" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-3558 size-full" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/11/17162207/Figure_16_02_02.jpg" alt="The lac operon consists of a promoter, an operator, and three genes named lacZ, lacY, and lacA that are located in sequential order on the DNA.

When glucose levels fall, <em>E. coli</em> may use other sugars for fuel but must transcribe new genes to do so. As glucose supplies become limited, cAMP levels increase. This cAMP binds to the CAP protein, a positive regulator that binds to an operator region upstream of the genes required to use other sugar sources.</p> </div> <h2>The <em>lac</em> Operon: An Inducer Operon</h2> <p>The third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through <strong>inducible operons</strong>, which have proteins that bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell. The <em>lac</em> operon is a typical inducible operon. As mentioned previously, <em>E. coli</em> is able to use other sugars as energy sources when glucose concentrations are low. To do so, the cAMP–CAP protein complex serves as a positive regulator to induce transcription. One such sugar source is lactose. The <strong><em>lac</em> operon&nbsp;</strong>encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment. CAP binds to the operator sequence upstream of the promoter that initiates transcription of the <em>lac</em> operon. However, for the <em>lac</em> operon to be activated, two conditions must be met. First, the level of glucose must be very low or non-existent. Second, lactose must be present. Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present will the <em>lac</em> operon be transcribed. This makes sense for the cell, because it would be energetically wasteful to create the proteins to process lactose if glucose was plentiful or lactose was not available.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <p>Transcription of the <em>lac</em> operon is carefully regulated so that its expression only occurs when glucose is limited and lactose is present to serve as an alternative fuel source.</p> <div class="wp-nocaption aligncenter size-full wp-image-3560"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3560" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/11/17162744/Figure_16_02_03.png" alt="The lac operon consists of a promoter, an operator, and three genes named lacZ, lacY, and lacA.

<div id="q703127" class="hidden-answer" style="display: none">Tryptophan is an amino acid essential for making proteins, so the cell always needs to have some on hand. However, if plenty of tryptophan is present, it is wasteful to make more, and the expression of the <em>trp</em> receptor is repressed. Lactose, a sugar found in milk, is not always available. It makes no sense to make the enzymes necessary to digest an energy source that is not available, so the lac operon is only turned on when lactose is present.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>If glucose is absent, then CAP can bind to the operator sequence to activate transcription. If lactose is absent, then the repressor binds to the operator to prevent transcription. If either of these requirements is met, then transcription remains off. Only when both conditions are satisfied is the <em>lac</em> operon transcribed (Table 1).</p>

<p>How the histone proteins move is dependent on signals found on both the histone proteins and on the DNA. These signals are tags added to histone proteins and DNA that tell the histones if a chromosomal region should be open or closed (Figure 3 depicts modifications to histone proteins and DNA). These tags are not permanent, but may be added or removed as needed. They are chemical modifications (phosphate, methyl, or acetyl groups) that are attached to specific amino acids in the protein or to the nucleotides of the DNA. The tags do not alter the DNA base sequence, but they do alter how tightly wound the DNA is around the histone proteins. DNA is a negatively charged molecule; therefore, changes in the charge of the histone will change how tightly wound the DNA molecule will be. When unmodified, the histone proteins have a large positive charge; by adding chemical modifications like acetyl groups, the charge becomes less positive.</p>
<p>The DNA molecule itself can also be modified. This occurs within very specific regions called CpG islands. These are stretches with a high frequency of cytosine and guanine dinucleotide DNA pairs (CG) found in the promoter regions of genes. When this configuration exists, the cytosine member of the pair can be methylated (a methyl group is added). This modification changes how the DNA interacts with proteins, including the histone proteins that control access to the region. Highly methylated (hypermethylated) DNA regions with deacetylated histones are tightly coiled and transcriptionally inactive.</p>

<p>This type of gene regulation is called epigenetic regulation. Epigenetic means “around genetics.” The changes that occur to the histone proteins and DNA do not alter the nucleotide sequence and are not permanent. Instead, these changes are temporary (although they often persist through multiple rounds of cell division) and alter the chromosomal structure (open or closed) as needed. A gene can be turned on or off depending upon the location and modifications to the histone proteins and DNA. If a gene is to be transcribed, the histone proteins and DNA are modified surrounding the chromosomal region encoding that gene. This opens the chromosomal region to allow access for RNA polymerase and other proteins, called transcription factors, to bind to the promoter region, located just upstream of the gene, and initiate transcription. If a gene is to remain turned off, or silenced, the histone proteins and DNA have different modifications that signal a closed chromosomal configuration. In this closed configuration, the RNA polymerase and transcription factors do not have access to the DNA and transcription cannot occur (Figure 2).</p>

<p>Like prokaryotic cells, the transcription of genes in eukaryotes requires the actions of an RNA polymerase to bind to a sequence upstream of a gene to initiate transcription. However, unlike prokaryotic cells, the eukaryotic RNA polymerase requires other proteins, or transcription factors, to facilitate transcription initiation. Transcription factors are proteins that bind to the promoter sequence and other regulatory sequences to control the transcription of the target gene. RNA polymerase by itself cannot initiate transcription in eukaryotic cells. Transcription factors must bind to the promoter region first and recruit RNA polymerase to the site for transcription to be established.</p>

<h3>The Promoter and the Transcription Machinery</h3>
<p>Genes are organized to make the control of gene expression easier. The promoter region is immediately upstream of the coding sequence. This region can be short (only a few nucleotides in length) or quite long (hundreds of nucleotides long). The longer the promoter, the more available space for proteins to bind. This also adds more control to the transcription process. The length of the promoter is gene-specific and can differ dramatically between genes. Consequently, the level of control of gene expression can also differ quite dramatically between genes. The purpose of the promoter is to bind transcription factors that control the initiation of transcription.</p>
<div id="attachment_3898" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-3898" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/12233554/Figure_16_04_01.jpg" alt="Eukaryotic gene expression is controlled by a promoter immediately adjacent to the gene, and an enhancer far upstream. The DNA folds over itself, bringing the enhancer next to the promoter. Transcription factors and mediator proteins are sandwiched between the promoter and the enhancer. Short DNA sequences within the enhancer called distal control elements bind activators, which in turn bind transcription factors and mediator proteins bound to the promoter. RNA polymerase binds the complex, allowing transcription to begin. Different genes have enhancers with different distal control elements, allowing differential regulation of transcription." width="450" height="527" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/12233554/Figure_16_04_01.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/12233554/Figure_16_04_01-256x300.jpg 256w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/12233554/Figure_16_04_01-65x76.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/12233554/Figure_16_04_01-225x263.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2016/12/12233554/Figure_16_04_01-350x410.jpg 350w" />
<p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1. An enhancer is a DNA sequence that promotes transcription. Each enhancer is made up of short DNA sequences called distal control elements. Activators bound to the distal control elements interact with mediator proteins and transcription factors. Two different genes may have the same promoter but different distal control elements, enabling differential gene expression.</p>
</div>
<p>Within the promoter region, just upstream of the transcriptional start site, resides the TATA box. This box is simply a repeat of thymine and adenine dinucleotides (literally, TATA repeats). RNA polymerase binds to the transcription initiation complex, allowing transcription to occur. To initiate transcription, a transcription factor (TFIID) is the first to bind to the TATA box. Binding of TFIID recruits other transcription factors, including TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH to the TATA box. Once this complex is assembled, RNA polymerase can bind to its upstream sequence. When bound along with the transcription factors, RNA polymerase is phosphorylated. This releases part of the protein from the DNA to activate the transcription initiation complex and places RNA polymerase in the correct orientation to begin transcription; DNA-bending protein brings the enhancer, which can be quite a distance from the gene, in contact with transcription factors and mediator proteins (Figure 1).</p>
<p>In addition to the general transcription factors, other transcription factors can bind to the promoter to regulate gene transcription. These transcription factors bind to the promoters of a specific set of genes. They are not general transcription factors that bind to every promoter complex, but are recruited to a specific sequence on the promoter of a specific gene. There are hundreds of transcription factors in a cell that each bind specifically to a particular DNA sequence motif. When transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene, it is referred to as a <em data-effect="italics">cis</em>-acting element, because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene. The region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site. Transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their binding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed.</p>
<h3>Enhancers and Transcription</h3>
<p>In some eukaryotic genes, there are regions that help increase or enhance transcription. These regions, called enhancers, are not necessarily close to the genes they enhance. They can be located upstream of a gene, within the coding region of the gene, downstream of a gene, or may be thousands of nucleotides away.</p>
<p>Enhancer regions are binding sequences, or sites, for transcription factors. When a DNA-bending protein binds, the shape of the DNA changes (Figure 1). This shape change allows for the interaction of the activators bound to the enhancers with the transcription factors bound to the promoter region and the RNA polymerase. Whereas DNA is generally depicted as a straight line in two dimensions, it is actually a three-dimensional object. Therefore, a nucleotide sequence thousands of nucleotides away can fold over and interact with a specific promoter.</p>
<h3>Turning Genes Off: Transcriptional Repressors</h3>
<p>Like prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells also have mechanisms to prevent transcription. Transcriptional repressors can bind to promoter or enhancer regions and block transcription. Like the transcriptional activators, repressors respond to external stimuli to prevent the binding of activating transcription factors.</p>

<h2>Post-Translational Control of Gene Expression</h2>
<p>RNA is transcribed, but must be processed into a mature form before translation can begin. This processing after an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but before it is translated into a protein, is called post-transcriptional modification. As with the epigenetic and transcriptional stages of processing, this post-transcriptional step can also be regulated to control gene expression in the cell. If the RNA is not processed, shuttled, or translated, then no protein will be synthesized.</p>
<h3>RNA splicing, the first stage of post-transcriptional control</h3>
<p>In eukaryotic cells, the RNA transcript often contains regions, called introns, that are removed prior to translation. The regions of RNA that code for protein are called exons (Figure 1). After an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but prior to its departure from the nucleus to be translated, the RNA is processed and the introns are removed by splicing.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2. There are five basic modes of alternative splicing.</p>
</div>
<p>In the 1970s, genes were first observed that exhibited alternative RNA splicing. Alternative RNA splicing is a mechanism that allows different protein products to be produced from one gene when different combinations of introns, and sometimes exons, are removed from the transcript (Figure 2). This alternative splicing can be haphazard, but more often it is controlled and acts as a mechanism of gene regulation, with the frequency of different splicing alternatives controlled by the cell as a way to control the production of different protein products in different cells or at different stages of development. Alternative splicing is now understood to be a common mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes; according to one estimate, 70 percent of genes in humans are expressed as multiple proteins through alternative splicing.</p>
<p>How could alternative splicing evolve? Introns have a beginning and ending recognition sequence; it is easy to imagine the failure of the splicing mechanism to identify the end of an intron and instead find the end of the next intron, thus removing two introns and the intervening exon. In fact, there are mechanisms in place to prevent such intron skipping, but mutations are likely to lead to their failure. Such “mistakes” would more than likely produce a nonfunctional protein. Indeed, the cause of many genetic diseases is alternative splicing rather than mutations in a sequence. However, alternative splicing would create a protein variant without the loss of the original protein, opening up possibilities for adaptation of the new variant to new functions. Gene duplication has played an important role in the evolution of new functions in a similar way by providing genes that may evolve without eliminating the original, functional protein.</p>

<h3>Control of RNA Stability</h3>
<p>Before the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is given two protective “caps” that prevent the end of the strand from degrading during its journey. The <strong>5′ cap</strong>, which is placed on the 5′ end of the mRNA, is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule (GTP). The <strong>poly-A tail</strong>, which is attached to the 3′ end, is usually composed of a series of adenine nucleotides. Once the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm, the length of time that the RNA resides there can be controlled. Each RNA molecule has a defined lifespan and decays at a specific rate. This rate of decay can influence how much protein is in the cell. If the decay rate is increased, the RNA will not exist in the cytoplasm as long, shortening the time for translation to occur. Conversely, if the rate of decay is decreased, the RNA molecule will reside in the cytoplasm longer and more protein can be translated. This rate of decay is referred to as the RNA stability. If the RNA is stable, it will be detected for longer periods of time in the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>Binding of proteins to the RNA can influence its stability. Proteins, called <strong>RNA-binding proteins</strong>, or RBPs, can bind to the regions of the RNA just upstream or downstream of the protein-coding region. These regions in the RNA that are not translated into protein are called the <strong>untranslated regions</strong>, or UTRs. They are not introns (those have been removed in the nucleus). Rather, these are regions that regulate mRNA localization, stability, and protein translation. The region just before the protein-coding region is called the <strong>5′ UTR</strong>, whereas the region after the coding region is called the <strong>3′ UTR</strong> (Figure 3). The binding of RBPs to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule, depending on the specific RBP that binds.</p>

<h2>RNA Stability and microRNAs</h2>
<p>In addition to RBPs that bind to and control (increase or decrease) RNA stability, other elements called microRNAs can bind to the RNA molecule. These <strong>microRNAs</strong>, or miRNAs, are short RNA molecules that are only 21–24 nucleotides in length. The miRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer pre-miRNAs. These pre-miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a protein called <strong>dicer</strong>. Like transcription factors and RBPs, mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA; however, miRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the <strong>RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)</strong>. RISC binds along with the miRNA to degrade the target mRNA. Together, miRNAs and the RISC complex rapidly destroy the RNA molecule.</p>

Epigenetic mechanisms control access to the chromosomal region to allow genes to be turned on or off. These mechanisms control how DNA is packed into the nucleus by regulating how tightly the DNA is wound around histone proteins. The addition or removal of chemical modifications (or flags) to histone proteins or DNA signals to the cell to open or close a chromosomal region. Therefore, eukaryotic cells can control whether a gene is expressed by controlling accessibility to transcription factors and the binding of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription.</p> <p>To start transcription, general transcription factors, such as TFIID, TFIIH, and others, must first bind to the TATA box and recruit RNA polymerase to that location. The binding of additional regulatory transcription factors to <em data-effect="italics">cis</em>-acting elements will either increase or prevent transcription. In addition to promoter sequences, enhancer regions help augment transcription. Enhancers can be upstream, downstream, within a gene itself, or on other chromosomes. Transcription factors bind to enhancer regions to increase or prevent transcription.</p> <p>Post-transcriptional control can occur at any stage after transcription, including RNA splicing, nuclear shuttling, and RNA stability. Once RNA is transcribed, it must be processed to create a mature RNA that is ready to be translated. This involves the removal of introns that do not code for protein. Spliceosomes bind to the signals that mark the exon/intron border to remove the introns and ligate the exons together. Once this occurs, the RNA is mature and can be translated. RNA is created and spliced in the nucleus, but needs to be transported to the cytoplasm to be translated. RNA is transported to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex. Once the RNA is in the cytoplasm, the length of time it resides there before being degraded, called RNA stability, can also be altered to control the overall amount of protein that is synthesized. The RNA stability can be increased, leading to longer residency time in the cytoplasm, or decreased, leading to shortened time and less protein synthesis. RNA stability is controlled by RNA-binding proteins (RPBs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). These RPBs and miRNAs bind to the 5′ UTR or the 3′ UTR of the RNA to increase or decrease RNA stability. Depending on the RBP, the stability can be increased or decreased significantly; however, miRNAs always decrease stability and promote decay.</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

This ensures that the cell has properly completed the step and has not encountered any mutation that will alter its function. Many proteins, including cyclin B, control these checkpoints. The phosphorylation of cyclin B, a post-translational event, alters its function. As a result, cells can progress through the cell cycle unimpeded, even if mutations exist in the cell and its growth should be terminated.</p> <h2>Cancer Treatment</h2> <p>Cancer therapies are designed to target actively dividing cells. Besides cancer cells, what other cells actively divide in humans? One of the most physically obvious side effects of cancer treatments is hair loss. This is because the living cells in the hair root continually divide to make hair grow longer. These cells therefore are often impacted by broad scale cancer treatments like chemotherapy drugs and radiation localized to the head. Shortly after cancer treatments, a patient’s blood count may also drop. This is due to the rapid division of blood cells throughout a person’s life. Unlike hair cells though, blood cells divide fairly often and rapidly. Hence, the blood count often returns to normal much faster than hair regrows.</p> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>New Drugs to Combat Cancer: Targeted Therapies</h3> <p id="fs-id1812931">Scientists are using what is known about the regulation of gene expression in disease states, including cancer, to develop new ways to treat and prevent disease development. Many scientists are designing drugs on the basis of the gene expression patterns within individual tumors. This idea, that therapy and medicines can be tailored to an individual, has given rise to the field of personalized medicine. With an increased understanding of gene regulation and gene function, medicines can be designed to specifically target diseased cells without harming healthy cells. Some new medicines, called targeted therapies, have exploited the overexpression of a specific protein or the mutation of a gene to develop a new medication to treat disease. One such example is the use of anti-EGF receptor medications to treat the subset of breast cancer tumors that have very high levels of the EGF protein. Undoubtedly, more targeted therapies will be developed as scientists learn more about how gene expression changes can cause cancer.</p> </div> <p>As scientists learn more about cell division and the unique ways it malfunctions in cancer cells, they are able to develop targeted therapies. These drugs are still chemotherapies, but they are often focused on a particular feature of different types of cancer cells, making them less likely to target non-cancerous dividing cells. This reduces global side effects. Unfortunately, our understanding of cancer is still incomplete. Therefore, every day cancer researchers and clinicians work to manage and treat these horrible diseases.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">Read more at <a href="https://www.cancer.org">www.cancer.org</a></div> </div><div class="licensing"><div class="license-attribution-dropdown-subheading">CC licensed content, Original</div><ul class="citation-list"><li>Putting It Together: Gene Expression. <strong>Provided by</strong>: Lumen Learning. <strong>License</strong>: <em><a target="_blank" rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY: Attribution</a></em></li></ul><div class="license-attribution-dropdown-subheading">CC licensed content, Shared previously</div><ul class="citation-list"><li>Biology. <strong>Provided by</strong>: OpenStax CNX. <strong>Located at</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="http://cnx.org/contents/185cbf87-c72e-48f5-b51e-f14f21b5eabd@10.8">http://cnx.org/contents/185cbf87-c72e-48f5-b51e-f14f21b5eabd@10.8</a>. <strong>License</strong>: <em><a target="_blank" rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY: Attribution</a></em>. <strong>License Terms</strong>: Download for free at http://cnx.org/contents/185cbf87-c72e-48f5-b51e-f14f21b5eabd@10.8</li></ul></div>

How much do you look like your parents? What about the other members of your family: aunts, uncles, cousins, full siblings, half-siblings? Why do some family members look nearly identical to each other, while other family members seem as if they don&#8217;t share two traits? The answer to this boils down to <em>how</em> traits are inherited.</p> <p>Parents pass on traits to their children. Traits like blood type, cleft chin, dimples, and widow’s peaks are all inherited in a fairly straight-forward, simple fashion. However, the inheritance of other traits is much more complex and harder to understand: these traits include height, skin color, and eye color. These more complex paths of inheritance are what cause some siblings to look so different from each other—despite having the same two parents.</p> <p>Unfortunately, genetics also plays a role in the inheritance of some diseases such as Huntingdon’s, sickle cell anemia, and Tay-Sachs disease. A degree in genetics can be used in careers ranging from a forensic examiner, a genetic counselor, a medical geneticist, a statistical geneticist, to a clinical technician.</p> <div class="textbox key-takeaways"><h3>Occupation Spotlight: Genetic Counselors</h3> <p>Genetic counselors use their understanding of the rules of heredity to help gauge the risks of genetic diseases. They may advise a couple of their risks for passing on certain genetic disorders, order genetic testing, and then explain the chances that some genetic diseases will show up in any offspring. Genetic counselors are there to help potential parents understand risk factors and the prognosis of genetic disorders, including basic treatment and management plans in the case of certain disorders.</p> </div> <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3> <ul><li>Identify the impact of Gregor Mendel on the field of genetics and apply Mendel&#8217;s two laws of genetics</li> <li>Explain complications to the phenotypic expression of genotype, including mutations</li> <li>Explain the conventions of a family pedigree and predict whether a disease will be passed through a family in one of three modes</li> <li>Discuss the role environment plays on phenotypes</li> </ul> </div><div class="licensing"><div class="license-attribution-dropdown-subheading">CC licensed content, Original</div><ul class="citation-list"><li>Why It Matters: Trait Inheritance. <strong>Authored by</strong>: Shelli Carter and Lumen Learning. <strong>Provided by</strong>: Lumen Learning. <strong>License</strong>: <em><a target="_blank" rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY: Attribution</a></em></li></ul></div>

Experimenting with thousands of garden peas, Mendel uncovered the fundamentals of genetics. (credit: modification of work by Jerry Kirkhart)</p> </div> <p>Genetics is the study of heredity. Johann Gregor Mendel set the framework for genetics long before chromosomes or genes had been identified, at a time when meiosis was not well understood. Mendel selected a simple biological system and conducted methodical, quantitative analyses using large sample sizes. Because of Mendel’s work, the fundamental principles of heredity were revealed. We now know that genes, carried on chromosomes, are the basic functional units of heredity with the capability to be replicated, expressed, or mutated. Today, the postulates put forth by Mendel form the basis of classical, or Mendelian, genetics. Not all genes are transmitted from parents to offspring according to Mendelian genetics, but Mendel’s experiments serve as an excellent starting point for thinking about inheritance.</p> <h3>Mendel’s Experiments and the Laws of Probability</h3> <div id="attachment_1387" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1387" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02180632/Figure_12_01_01.jpg" alt="Sketch of Gregor Mendel, a monk who wore reading glasses and a large cross." width="250" height="298" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02180632/Figure_12_01_01.jpg 450w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02180632/Figure_12_01_01-251x300.jpg 251w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02180632/Figure_12_01_01-65x78.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02180632/Figure_12_01_01-225x269.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02180632/Figure_12_01_01-350x418.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure&nbsp;2. Johann Gregor Mendel is considered the father of genetics.</p> </div> <p>Johann Gregor Mendel (1822–1884) (Figure&nbsp;2) was a lifelong learner, teacher, scientist, and man of faith. As a young adult, he joined the Augustinian Abbey of St. Thomas in Brno in what is now the Czech Republic. Supported by the monastery, he taught physics, botany, and natural science courses at the secondary and university levels. In 1856, he began a decade-long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in honeybees and plants, ultimately settling on pea plants as his primary&nbsp;<strong>model system</strong> (a system with convenient characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon to be applied to other systems). In 1865, Mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly 30,000 pea plants to the local Natural History Society. He demonstrated that traits are transmitted faithfully from parents to offspring independently of other traits and in dominant and recessive patterns. In 1866, he published his work, <em>Experiments in Plant Hybridization,</em> in the proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn.</p> <p>Mendel’s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community that believed, incorrectly, that the process of inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring; this hypothetical process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation.&nbsp;<strong>Continuous variation</strong> results from the action of many genes to determine a characteristic like human height. Offspring appear to be a “blend” of their parents’ traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation. The <strong>blending theory of inheritance</strong> asserted that the original parental traits were lost or absorbed by the blending in the offspring, but we now know that this is not the case. Mendel was the first researcher to see it. Instead of continuous characteristics, Mendel worked with traits that were inherited in distinct classes (specifically, violet versus white flowers); this is referred to as <strong>discontinuous variation</strong>. Mendel’s choice of these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring, nor were they absorbed, but rather that they kept their distinctness and could be passed on. In 1868, Mendel became abbot of the monastery and exchanged his scientific pursuits for his pastoral duties. He was not recognized for his extraordinary scientific contributions during his lifetime. In fact, it was not until 1900 that his work was rediscovered, reproduced, and revitalized by scientists on the brink of discovering the chromosomal basis of heredity.</p> <h3>Mendel’s Model System</h3> <p>Mendel’s seminal work was accomplished using the garden pea,&nbsp;<em>Pisum sativum</em>, to study inheritance. This species naturally self-fertilizes, such that pollen encounters ova within individual flowers. The flower petals remain sealed tightly until after pollination, preventing pollination from other plants. The result is highly inbred, or “true-breeding,” pea plants. These are plants that always produce offspring that look like the parent. By experimenting with true-breeding pea plants, Mendel avoided the appearance of unexpected traits in offspring that might occur if the plants were not true breeding. The garden pea also grows to maturity within one season, meaning that several generations could be evaluated over a relatively short time. Finally, large quantities of garden peas could be cultivated simultaneously, allowing Mendel to conclude that his results did not come about simply by chance.</p> <h3>Mendelian Crosses</h3> <p>Mendel performed&nbsp;<strong>hybridizations</strong>, which involve mating two true-breeding individuals that have different traits. In the pea, which is naturally self-pollinating, this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of one variety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety. In plants, pollen carries the male gametes (sperm) to the stigma, a sticky organ that traps pollen and allows the sperm to move down the pistil to the female gametes (ova) below. To prevent the pea plant that was receiving pollen from self-fertilizing and confounding his results, Mendel painstakingly removed all of the anthers from the plant’s flowers before they had a chance to mature.</p> <p>Plants used in first-generation crosses were called P<sub>0</sub>, or parental generation one, plants (Figure&nbsp;3). Mendel collected the seeds belonging to the P<sub>0</sub> plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season. These offspring were called the&nbsp;<strong>F<sub data-redactor-tag="sub">1</sub></strong>, or the first filial (<em>filial </em>= offspring, daughter or son), generation. Once Mendel examined the characteristics in the F<sub>1</sub> generation of plants, he allowed them to self-fertilize naturally. He then collected and grew the seeds from the F<sub>1</sub> plants to produce the <strong>F<sub data-redactor-tag="sub">2</sub></strong>, or second filial, generation. Mendel’s experiments extended beyond the F<sub>2</sub> generation to the F<sub>3</sub> and F<sub>4</sub>generations, and so on, but it was the ratio of characteristics in the P<sub>0</sub>−F<sub>1</sub>−F<sub>2</sub> generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis for Mendel’s postulates.</p> <div id="attachment_1390" style="width: 528px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1390" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02180814/Figure_12_01_02-518x1024.jpg" alt="The diagram shows a cross between pea plants that are true-breeding for purple flower color and plants true-breeding for white flower color.

A&nbsp;<strong>trait</strong> is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic. The characteristics included plant height, seed texture, seed color, flower color, pea pod size, pea pod color, and flower position. For the characteristic of flower color, for example, the two contrasting traits were white versus violet. To fully examine each characteristic, Mendel generated large numbers of F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> plants, reporting results from 19,959 F<sub>2</sub> plants alone. His findings were consistent.</p> <p>What results did Mendel find in his crosses for flower color? First, Mendel confirmed that he had plants that bred true for white or violet flower color. Regardless of how many generations Mendel examined, all self-crossed offspring of parents with white flowers had white flowers, and all self-crossed offspring of parents with violet flowers had violet flowers. In addition, Mendel confirmed that, other than flower color, the pea plants were physically identical.</p> <p>Once these validations were complete, Mendel applied the pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers. After gathering and sowing the seeds that resulted from this cross, Mendel found that 100 percent of the F<sub>1</sub> hybrid generation had violet flowers. Conventional wisdom at that time would have predicted the hybrid flowers to be pale violet or for hybrid plants to have equal numbers of white and violet flowers. In other words, the contrasting parental traits were expected to blend in the offspring. Instead, Mendel’s results demonstrated that the white flower trait in the F<sub>1</sub> generation had completely disappeared.</p> <p>Importantly, Mendel did not stop his experimentation there. He allowed the F<sub>1</sub> plants to self-fertilize and found that, of F<sub>2</sub>-generation plants, 705 had violet flowers and 224 had white flowers. This was a ratio of 3.15 violet flowers per one white flower, or approximately 3:1. When Mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers and vice versa, he obtained about the same ratio regardless of which parent, male or female, contributed which trait. This is called a&nbsp;<strong>reciprocal cross</strong>—a paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the respective traits of the female and male in the other cross. For the other six characteristics Mendel examined, the F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> generations behaved in the same way as they had for flower color. One of the two traits would disappear completely from the F<sub>1</sub> generation only to reappear in the F<sub>2</sub> generation at a ratio of approximately 3:1 (Table&nbsp;1).</p> <table><thead><tr><th colspan="5">Table&nbsp;1.

He called these, respectively, dominant and recessive traits.&nbsp;<strong>Dominant traits</strong> are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization. <strong>Recessive traits</strong> become latent, or disappear, in the offspring of a hybridization. The recessive trait does, however, reappear in the progeny of the hybrid offspring. An example of a dominant trait is the violet-flower trait. For this same characteristic (flower color), white-colored flowers are a recessive trait. The fact that the recessive trait reappeared in the F<sub>2</sub> generation meant that the traits remained separate (not blended) in the plants of the F<sub>1</sub> generation. Mendel also proposed that plants possessed two copies of the trait for the flower-color characteristic, and that each parent transmitted one of its two copies to its offspring, where they came together. Moreover, the physical observation of a dominant trait could mean that the genetic composition of the organism included two dominant versions of the characteristic or that it included one dominant and one recessive version. Conversely, the observation of a recessive trait meant that the organism lacked any dominant versions of this characteristic.</p> <p>So why did Mendel repeatedly obtain 3:1 ratios in his crosses? To understand how Mendel deduced the basic mechanisms of inheritance that lead to such ratios, we must first review the laws of probability.</p> <h3>Probability Basics</h3> <p>Probabilities are mathematical measures of likelihood. The empirical probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of times the event occurs by the total number of opportunities for the event to occur. It is also possible to calculate theoretical probabilities by dividing the number of times that an event is expected to occur by the number of times that it could occur. Empirical probabilities come from observations, like those of Mendel. Theoretical probabilities come from knowing how the events are produced and assuming that the probabilities of individual outcomes are equal. A probability of one for some event indicates that it is guaranteed to occur, whereas a probability of zero indicates that it is guaranteed not to occur. An example of a genetic event is a round seed produced by a pea plant. In his experiment, Mendel demonstrated that the probability of the event “round seed” occurring was one in the F<sub>1</sub> offspring of true-breeding parents, one of which has round seeds and one of which has wrinkled seeds. When the F<sub>1</sub> plants were subsequently self-crossed, the probability of any given F<sub>2</sub> offspring having round seeds was now three out of four. In other words, in a large population of F<sub>2</sub> offspring chosen at random, 75 percent were expected to have round seeds, whereas 25 percent were expected to have wrinkled seeds. Using large numbers of crosses, Mendel was able to calculate probabilities and use these to predict the outcomes of other crosses.</p> <h4>The Product Rule and Sum Rule</h4> <p>Mendel demonstrated that the pea-plant characteristics he studied were transmitted as discrete units from parent to offspring. As will be discussed, Mendel also determined that different characteristics, like seed color and seed texture, were transmitted independently of one another and could be considered in separate probability analyses. For instance, performing a cross between a plant with green, wrinkled seeds and a plant with yellow, round seeds still produced offspring that had a 3:1 ratio of green:yellow seeds (ignoring seed texture) and a 3:1 ratio of round:wrinkled seeds (ignoring seed color). The characteristics of color and texture did not influence each other.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<strong>product</strong> rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent transmission of characteristics. The product rule states that the probability of two independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of each event occurring alone. To demonstrate the product rule, imagine that you are rolling a six-sided die (D) and flipping a penny (P) at the same time. The die may roll any number from 1–6 (D#), whereas the penny may turn up heads (PH) or tails (PT). The outcome of rolling the die has no effect on the outcome of flipping the penny and vice versa. There are 12 possible outcomes of this action (Table&nbsp;2), and each event is expected to occur with equal probability.</p> <table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Table&nbsp;2. Twelve Equally Likely Outcomes of Rolling a Die and Flipping a Penny</th> </tr> <tr><th>Rolling Die</th> <th>Flipping Penny</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr><td>D1</td> <td>PH</td> </tr> <tr><td>D1</td> <td>PT</td> </tr> <tr><td>D2</td> <td>PH</td> </tr> <tr><td>D2</td> <td>PT</td> </tr> <tr><td>D3</td> <td>PH</td> </tr> <tr><td>D3</td> <td>PT</td> </tr> <tr><td>D4</td> <td>PH</td> </tr> <tr><td>D4</td> <td>PT</td> </tr> <tr><td>D5</td> <td>PH</td> </tr> <tr><td>D5</td> <td>PT</td> </tr> <tr><td>D6</td> <td>PH</td> </tr> <tr><td>D6</td> <td>PT</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Of the 12 possible outcomes, the die has a 2/12 (or 1/6) probability of rolling a two, and the penny has a 6/12 (or 1/2) probability of coming up heads. By the product rule, the probability that you will obtain the combined outcome 2 and heads is: (D2) x (PH) = (1/6) x (1/2) or 1/12 (Table&nbsp;3). Notice the word “and” in the description of the probability. The “and” is a signal to apply the product rule. For example, consider how the product rule is applied to the dihybrid cross: the probability of having both dominant traits in the F2progeny is the product of the probabilities of having the dominant trait for each characteristic, as shown here:</p> <p>On the other hand, the&nbsp;<strong>sum rule</strong> of probability is applied when considering two mutually exclusive outcomes that can come about by more than one pathway. The sum rule states that the probability of the occurrence of one event or the other event, of two mutually exclusive events, is the sum of their individual probabilities. Notice the word “or” in the description of the probability. The “or” indicates that you should apply the sum rule. In this case, let’s imagine you are flipping a penny (P) and a quarter (Q). What is the probability of one coin coming up heads and one coin coming up tails? This outcome can be achieved by two cases: the penny may be heads (PH) and the quarter may be tails (QT), or the quarter may be heads (QH) and the penny may be tails (PT). Either case fulfills the outcome. By the sum rule, we calculate the probability of obtaining one head and one tail as [(PH) × (QT)] + [(QH) × (PT)] = [(1/2) × (1/2)] + [(1/2) × (1/2)] = 1/2 (Table&nbsp;3). You should also notice that we used the product rule to calculate the probability of PH and QT, and also the probability of PT and QH, before we summed them. Again, the sum rule can be applied to show the probability of having just one dominant trait in the F2 generation of a dihybrid cross:</p> <table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Table&nbsp;3. The Product Rule and Sum Rule</th> </tr> <tr><th>Product Rule</th> <th>Sum Rule</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr><td>For independent events A and B, the probability (P) of them both occurring (A&nbsp;<em>and</em> B) is (PA × PB)</td> <td>For mutually exclusive events A and B, the probability (P) that at least one occurs (A&nbsp;<em>or</em> B) is (PA + PB)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>To use probability laws in practice, it is necessary to work with large sample sizes because small sample sizes are prone to deviations caused by chance. The large quantities of pea plants that Mendel examined allowed him calculate the probabilities of the traits appearing in his F<sub>2</sub> generation. As you will learn, this discovery meant that when parental traits were known, the offspring’s traits could be predicted accurately even before fertilization.</p> <h2>Characteristics and Traits</h2> <p>The seven characteristics that Mendel evaluated in his pea plants were each expressed as one of two versions, or traits. The physical expression of characteristics is accomplished through the expression of genes carried on chromosomes. The genetic makeup of peas consists of two similar or homologous copies of each chromosome, one from each parent. Each pair of homologous chromosomes has the same linear order of genes. In other words, peas are diploid organisms in that they have two copies of each chromosome. The same is true for many other plants and for virtually all animals. Diploid organisms utilize meiosis to produce haploid gametes, which contain one copy of each homologous chromosome that unite at fertilization to create a diploid zygote.</p> <p>For cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic, a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or may not encode the same version of that characteristic. Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes are called alleles. Mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele forms, but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population.</p> <h3>Phenotypes and Genotypes</h3> <p>Two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics. The observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its&nbsp;<strong>phenotype</strong>. An organism’s underlying genetic makeup, consisting of both physically visible and non-expressed alleles, is called its <strong>genotype</strong>. Mendel’s hybridization experiments demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype. When true-breeding plants in which one parent had yellow pods and one had green pods were cross-fertilized, all of the F<sub>1</sub> hybrid offspring had yellow pods. That is, the hybrid offspring were phenotypically identical to the true-breeding parent with yellow pods. However, we know that the allele donated by the parent with green pods was not simply lost because it reappeared in some of the F<sub>2</sub> offspring. Therefore, the F<sub>1</sub> plants must have been genotypically different from the parent with yellow pods.</p> <p>The P<sub>0</sub> plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying. Diploid organisms that are&nbsp;<strong>homozygous</strong> at a given gene, or locus, have two identical alleles for that gene on their homologous chromosomes. Mendel’s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait. When P<sub>0</sub> plants with contrasting traits were cross-fertilized, all of the offspring were heterozygous for the contrasting trait, meaning that their genotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined.</p> <h3>Dominant and Recessive Alleles</h3> <p>Our discussion of homozygous and heterozygous organisms brings us to why the F<sub>1</sub> heterozygous offspring were identical to one of the parents, rather than expressing both alleles. In all seven pea-plant characteristics, one of the two contrasting alleles was dominant, and the other was recessive. Mendel called the dominant allele the expressed unit factor; the recessive allele was referred to as the latent unit factor. We now know that these so-called unit factors are actually genes on homologous chromosome pairs. For a gene that is expressed in a dominant and recessive pattern, homozygous dominant and heterozygous organisms will look identical (that is, they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype). The recessive allele will only be observed in homozygous recessive individuals (Table 4).</p> <table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Table 4. Human Inheritance in Dominant and Recessive Patterns</th> </tr> <tr><th>Dominant Traits</th> <th>Recessive Traits</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr><td>Achondroplasia</td> <td>Albinism</td> </tr> <tr><td>Brachydactyly</td> <td>Cystic fibrosis</td> </tr> <tr><td>Huntington’s disease</td> <td>Duchenne muscular dystrophy</td> </tr> <tr><td>Marfan syndrome</td> <td>Galactosemia</td> </tr> <tr><td>Neurofibromatosis</td> <td>Phenylketonuria</td> </tr> <tr><td>Widow’s peak</td> <td>Sickle-cell anemia</td> </tr> <tr><td>Wooly hair</td> <td>Tay-Sachs disease</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Several conventions exist for referring to genes and alleles. For the purposes of this chapter, we will abbreviate genes using the first letter of the gene’s corresponding dominant trait. For example, violet is the dominant trait for a pea plant’s flower color, so the flower-color gene would be abbreviated as&nbsp;<em>V</em> (note that it is customary to italicize gene designations). Furthermore, we will use uppercase and lowercase letters to represent dominant and recessive alleles, respectively. Therefore, we would refer to the genotype of a homozygous dominant pea plant with violet flowers as <em>VV</em>, a homozygous recessive pea plant with white flowers as <em>vv</em>, and a heterozygous pea plant with violet flowers as <em>Vv</em>.</p> <h3>The Punnett Square Approach for a Monohybrid Cross</h3> <p>When fertilization occurs between two true-breeding parents that differ in only one characteristic, the process is called a&nbsp;<strong>monohybrid</strong> cross, and the resulting offspring are monohybrids. Mendel performed seven monohybrid crosses involving contrasting traits for each characteristic. On the basis of his results in F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> generations, Mendel postulated that each parent in the monohybrid cross contributed one of two paired unit factors to each offspring, and every possible combination of unit factors was equally likely.</p> <p>To demonstrate a monohybrid cross, consider the case of true-breeding pea plants with yellow versus green pea seeds. The dominant seed color is yellow; therefore, the parental genotypes were&nbsp;<em>YY</em> for the plants with yellow seeds and <em>yy</em> for the plants with green seeds, respectively. A <strong>Punnett square</strong>, devised by the British geneticist Reginald Punnett, can be drawn that applies the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic cross or mating and their expected frequencies. To prepare a Punnett square, all possible combinations of the parental alleles are listed along the top (for one parent) and side (for the other parent) of a grid, representing their meiotic segregation into haploid gametes. Then the combinations of egg and sperm are made in the boxes in the table to show which alleles are combining. Each box then represents the diploid genotype of a zygote, or fertilized egg, that could result from this mating. Because each possibility is equally likely, genotypic ratios can be determined from a Punnett square. If the pattern of inheritance (dominant or recessive) is known, the phenotypic ratios can be inferred as well. For a monohybrid cross of two true-breeding parents, each parent contributes one type of allele. In this case, only one genotype is possible. All offspring are <em>Yy</em> and have yellow seeds (Figure 4).</p> <div id="attachment_1392" style="width: 461px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1392" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02180907/Figure_12_02_02.png" alt="This illustration shows a monohybrid cross.

Self-pollination of the F_{1} generation results in an F_{2} generation with a 3 to 1 ratio of yellow to green peas.

In the P<sub>0</sub> generation, pea plants that are true-breeding for the dominant yellow phenotype are crossed with plants with the recessive green phenotype. This cross produces F<sub>1</sub> heterozygotes with a yellow phenotype. Punnett square analysis can be used to predict the genotypes of the F<sub>2</sub> generation.</p> </div> <p>A self-cross of one of the&nbsp;<em>Yy</em> heterozygous offspring can be represented in a 2 × 2 Punnett square because each parent can donate one of two different alleles. Therefore, the offspring can potentially have one of four allele combinations: <em>YY</em>, <em>Yy</em>, <em>yY</em>, or <em>yy</em> (Figure 4). Notice that there are two ways to obtain the <em>Yy</em> genotype: a <em>Y</em> from the egg and a <em>y</em> from the sperm, or a <em>y</em> from the egg and a <em>Y</em> from the sperm. Both of these possibilities must be counted. Recall that Mendel’s pea-plant characteristics behaved in the same way in reciprocal crosses. Therefore, the two possible heterozygous combinations produce offspring that are genotypically and phenotypically identical despite their dominant and recessive alleles deriving from different parents. They are grouped together. Because fertilization is a random event, we expect each combination to be equally likely and for the offspring to exhibit a ratio of&nbsp;<em>YY</em>:<em>Yy</em>:<em>yy</em> genotypes of 1:2:1 (Figure 4). Furthermore, because the <em>YY</em> and <em>Yy</em> offspring have yellow seeds and are phenotypically identical, applying the sum rule of probability, we expect the offspring to exhibit a phenotypic ratio of 3 yellow:1 green. Indeed, working with large sample sizes, Mendel observed approximately this ratio in every F<sub>2</sub> generation resulting from crosses for individual traits.</p> <p>Mendel validated these results by performing an F<sub>3</sub> cross in which he self-crossed the dominant- and recessive-expressing F<sub>2</sub> plants. When he self-crossed the plants expressing green seeds, all of the offspring had green seeds, confirming that all green seeds had homozygous genotypes of&nbsp;<em>yy</em>. When he self-crossed the F<sub>2</sub> plants expressing yellow seeds, he found that one-third of the plants bred true, and two-thirds of the plants segregated at a 3:1 ratio of yellow:green seeds. In this case, the true-breeding plants had homozygous (<em>YY</em>) genotypes, whereas the segregating plants corresponded to the heterozygous (<em>Yy</em>) genotype. When these plants self-fertilized, the outcome was just like the F<sub>1</sub> self-fertilizing cross.</p> <h4>The Test Cross Distinguishes the Dominant Phenotype</h4> <p>Beyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents, Mendel also developed a way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a homozygote. Called the test cross, this technique is still used by plant and animal breeders. In a test cross, the dominant-expressing organism is crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic. If the dominant-expressing organism is a homozygote, then all F<sub>1</sub> offspring will be heterozygotes expressing the dominant trait (Figure 5). Alternatively, if the dominant expressing organism is a heterozygote, the F<sub>1</sub> offspring will exhibit a 1:1 ratio of heterozygotes and recessive homozygotes (Figure 5). The test cross further validates Mendel’s postulate that pairs of unit factors segregate equally.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <div id="attachment_1394" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1394" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02181146/Figure_12_02_03.jpg" alt="In a test cross, a parent with a dominant phenotype but unknown genotype is crossed with a recessive parent.

<p>Many human diseases are genetically inherited. A healthy person in a family in which some members suffer from a recessive genetic disorder may want to know if he or she has the disease-causing gene and what risk exists of passing the disorder on to his or her offspring. Of course, doing a test cross in humans is unethical and impractical. Instead, geneticists use pedigree analysis to study the inheritance pattern of human genetic diseases (Figure 6).</p>

As you have learned, more complex extensions of Mendelism exist that do not exhibit the same F<sub>2</sub> phenotypic ratios (3:1). Nevertheless, these laws summarize the basics of classical genetics.</p> <h3>Pairs of Unit Factors, or Genes</h3> <p>Mendel proposed first that paired unit factors of heredity were transmitted faithfully from generation to generation by the dissociation and reassociation of paired factors during gametogenesis and fertilization, respectively. After he crossed peas with contrasting traits and found that the recessive trait resurfaced in the F<sub>2</sub> generation, Mendel deduced that hereditary factors must be inherited as discrete units. This finding contradicted the belief at that time that parental traits were blended in the offspring.</p> <h3>Alleles Can Be Dominant or Recessive</h3> <div id="attachment_1398" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1398" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02181324/Figure_12_03_01.jpg" alt="Photo shows an albino child with his black mother." width="250" height="313" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02181324/Figure_12_03_01.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02181324/Figure_12_03_01-240x300.jpg 240w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02181324/Figure_12_03_01-65x81.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02181324/Figure_12_03_01-225x281.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02181324/Figure_12_03_01-350x438.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 7. The child in the photo expresses albinism, a recessive trait.</p> </div> <p>Mendel’s <strong>law of dominance</strong> states that in a heterozygote, one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic. Rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype, the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively. The recessive allele will remain “latent” but will be transmitted to offspring by the same manner in which the dominant allele is transmitted. The recessive trait will only be expressed by offspring that have two copies of this allele (Figure 7), and these offspring will breed true when self-crossed.</p> <p>Since Mendel’s experiments with pea plants, other researchers have found that the law of dominance does not always hold true. Instead, several different patterns of inheritance have been found to exist.</p> <h3>Equal Segregation of Alleles</h3> <p>Observing that true-breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to F<sub>1</sub> generations that all expressed the dominant trait and F<sub>2</sub> generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a 3:1 ratio, Mendel proposed the&nbsp;<strong>law of segregation</strong>. This law states that paired unit factors (genes) must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor. For the F<sub>2</sub> generation of a monohybrid cross, the following three possible combinations of genotypes could result: homozygous dominant, heterozygous, or homozygous recessive. Because heterozygotes could arise from two different pathways (receiving one dominant and one recessive allele from either parent), and because heterozygotes and homozygous dominant individuals are phenotypically identical, the law supports Mendel’s observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio. The equal segregation of alleles is the reason we can apply the Punnett square to accurately predict the offspring of parents with known genotypes. The physical basis of Mendel’s law of segregation is the first division of meiosis, in which the homologous chromosomes with their different versions of each gene are segregated into daughter nuclei. The role of the meiotic segregation of chromosomes in sexual reproduction was not understood by the scientific community during Mendel’s lifetime.</p> <h3>Independent Assortment</h3> <p>Mendel’s&nbsp;<strong>law of independent assortment</strong> states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes, and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur. The independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the <strong>dihybrid</strong> cross, a cross between two true-breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics. Consider the characteristics of seed color and seed texture for two pea plants, one that has green, wrinkled seeds (<em>yyrr</em>) and another that has yellow, round seeds (<em>YYRR</em>). Because each parent is homozygous, the law of segregation indicates that the gametes for the green/wrinkled plant all are <em>yr</em>, and the gametes for the yellow/round plant are all <em>YR</em>. Therefore, the F<sub>1</sub> generation of offspring all are<em>YyRr</em> (Figure 8).</p> <div id="attachment_1400" style="width: 735px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1400" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02181455/Figure_12_03_02.png" alt="This illustration shows a dihybrid cross between pea plants.

The former two genotypes would result in plants with purple flowers and yellow peas, while the latter two genotypes would result in plants with white flowers with yellow peas, for a 1:1 ratio of each phenotype. You only need a 2 × 2 Punnett square (four squares total) to do this analysis because two of the alleles are homozygous.</div> </div> </div> <p>For the F<sub>2</sub> generation, the law of segregation requires that each gamete receive either an&nbsp;<em>R</em> allele or an <em>r</em> allele along with either a <em>Y&nbsp;</em>allele or a <em>y</em> allele. The law of independent assortment states that a gamete into which an <em>r</em> allele sorted would be equally likely to contain either a <em>Y</em> allele or a <em>y</em> allele. Thus, there are four equally likely gametes that can be formed when the <em>YyRr</em> heterozygote is self-crossed, as follows: <em>YR</em>, <em>Yr</em>, <em>yR</em>, and <em>yr</em>. Arranging these gametes along the top and left of a 4 × 4 Punnett square (Figure 8) gives us 16 equally likely genotypic combinations. From these genotypes, we infer a phenotypic ratio of 9 round/yellow:3 round/green:3 wrinkled/yellow:1 wrinkled/green (Figure 8). These are the offspring ratios we would expect, assuming we performed the crosses with a large enough sample size.</p> <p>Because of independent assortment and dominance, the 9:3:3:1 dihybrid phenotypic ratio can be collapsed into two 3:1 ratios, characteristic of any monohybrid cross that follows a dominant and recessive pattern. Ignoring seed color and considering only seed texture in the above dihybrid cross, we would expect that three quarters of the F<sub>2</sub> generation offspring would be round, and one quarter would be wrinkled. Similarly, isolating only seed color, we would assume that three quarters of the F<sub>2</sub> offspring would be yellow and one quarter would be green. The sorting of alleles for texture and color are independent events, so we can apply the product rule. Therefore, the proportion of round and yellow F<sub>2</sub> offspring is expected to be (3/4) × (3/4) = 9/16, and the proportion of wrinkled and green offspring is expected to be (1/4) × (1/4) = 1/16. These proportions are identical to those obtained using a Punnett square. Round, green and wrinkled, yellow offspring can also be calculated using the product rule, as each of these genotypes includes one dominant and one recessive phenotype. Therefore, the proportion of each is calculated as (3/4) × (1/4) = 3/16.</p> <p>The law of independent assortment also indicates that a cross between yellow, wrinkled (<em>YYrr</em>) and green, round (<em>yyRR</em>) parents would yield the same F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> offspring as in the <em>YYRR</em> x <em>yyrr</em> cross.</p> <p>The physical basis for the law of independent assortment also lies in meiosis I, in which the different homologous pairs line up in random orientations. Each gamete can contain any combination of paternal and maternal chromosomes (and therefore the genes on them) because the orientation of tetrads on the metaphase plane is random.</p> <p>In pea plants, purple flowers (P) are dominant to white flowers (p) and yellow peas (Y) are dominant to green peas (y). What are the possible genotypes and phenotypes for a cross between PpYY and ppYy pea plants? How many squares do you need to do a Punnett square analysis of this cross? The possible genotypes are PpYY, PpYy, ppYY, and ppYy. The former two genotypes would result in plants with purple flowers and yellow peas, while the latter two genotypes would result in plants with white flowers with yellow peas, for a 1:1 ratio of each phenotype. You only need a 2 × 2 Punnett square (four squares total) to do this analysis because two of the alleles are homozygous.</p> <h4>Forked-Line Method</h4> <p>When more than two genes are being considered, the Punnett-square method becomes unwieldy. For instance, examining a cross involving four genes would require a 16 × 16 grid containing 256 boxes. It would be extremely cumbersome to manually enter each genotype. For more complex crosses, the forked-line and probability methods are preferred.</p> <p>To prepare a forked-line diagram for a cross between F<sub>1</sub> heterozygotes resulting from a cross between&nbsp;<em>AABBCC</em> and <em>aabbcc</em> parents, we first create rows equal to the number of genes being considered, and then segregate the alleles in each row on forked lines according to the probabilities for individual monohybrid crosses (Figure 9). We then multiply the values along each forked path to obtain the F<sub>2</sub> offspring probabilities. Note that this process is a diagrammatic version of the product rule. The values along each forked pathway can be multiplied because each gene assorts independently.

The probability for each possible combination of traits is calculated by multiplying the probability for each individual trait. Thus, the probability of F<sub>2</sub> offspring having yellow, round, and tall traits is 3 × 3 × 3, or 27.</p> </div> <h4>Probability Method</h4> <p>While the forked-line method is a diagrammatic approach to keeping track of probabilities in a cross, the probability method gives the proportions of offspring expected to exhibit each phenotype (or genotype) without the added visual assistance. Both methods make use of the product rule and consider the alleles for each gene separately. Earlier, we examined the phenotypic proportions for a trihybrid cross using the forked-line method; now we will use the probability method to examine the genotypic proportions for a cross with even more genes.</p> <p>For a trihybrid cross, writing out the forked-line method is tedious, albeit not as tedious as using the Punnett-square method. To fully demonstrate the power of the probability method, however, we can consider specific genetic calculations. For instance, for a tetrahybrid cross between individuals that are heterozygotes for all four genes, and in which all four genes are sorting independently and in a dominant and recessive pattern, what proportion of the offspring will be expected to be homozygous recessive for all four alleles? Rather than writing out every possible genotype, we can use the probability method. We know that for each gene, the fraction of homozygous recessive offspring will be 1/4. Therefore, multiplying this fraction for each of the four genes, (1/4) × (1/4) × (1/4) × (1/4), we determine that 1/256 of the offspring will be quadruply homozygous recessive.</p> <p>For the same tetrahybrid cross, what is the expected proportion of offspring that have the dominant phenotype at all four loci? We can answer this question using phenotypic proportions, but let’s do it the hard way—using genotypic proportions. The question asks for the proportion of offspring that are 1) homozygous dominant at&nbsp;<em>A</em> or heterozygous at <em>A,</em> and 2) homozygous at <em>B</em> or heterozygous at <em>B</em>, and so on. Noting the “or” and “and” in each circumstance makes clear where to apply the sum and product rules. The probability of a homozygous dominant at <em>A</em> is 1/4 and the probability of a heterozygote at <em>A</em> is 1/2. The probability of the homozygote or the heterozygote is 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 using the sum rule. The same probability can be obtained in the same way for each of the other genes, so that the probability of a dominant phenotype at <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> and <em>D</em> is, using the product rule, equal to 3/4 × 3/4 × 3/4 × 3/4, or 27/64. If you are ever unsure about how to combine probabilities, returning to the forked-line method should make it clear.</p> <h4>Rules for Multihybrid Fertilization</h4> <p>Predicting the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring from given crosses is the best way to test your knowledge of Mendelian genetics. Given a multihybrid cross that obeys independent assortment and follows a dominant and recessive pattern, several generalized rules exist; you can use these rules to check your results as you work through genetics calculations (Table 1). To apply these rules, first you must determine&nbsp;<em>n</em>, the number of heterozygous gene pairs (the number of genes segregating two alleles each). For example, a cross between <em>AaBb</em> and <em>AaBb</em> heterozygotes has an <em>n</em> of 2. In contrast, a cross between <em>AABb</em> and <em>AABb</em> has an <em>n</em> of 1 because <em>A</em> is not heterozygous.</p> <table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Table 1.

Genes that are located on separate non-homologous chromosomes will always sort independently. However, each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes, organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string. The segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced by linkage, in which genes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as a pair. However, because of the process of recombination, or “crossover,” it is possible for two genes on the same chromosome to behave independently, or as if they are not linked. To understand this, let’s consider the biological basis of gene linkage and recombination.</p> <p>Homologous chromosomes possess the same genes in the same linear order. The alleles may differ on homologous chromosome pairs, but the genes to which they correspond do not. In preparation for the first division of meiosis, homologous chromosomes replicate and synapse. Like genes on the homologs align with each other. At this stage, segments of homologous chromosomes exchange linear segments of genetic material (Figure 10). This process is called recombination, or crossover, and it is a common genetic process. Because the genes are aligned during recombination, the gene order is not altered. Instead, the result of recombination is that maternal and paternal alleles are combined onto the same chromosome. Across a given chromosome, several recombination events may occur, causing extensive shuffling of alleles.</p> <div id="attachment_1402" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1402" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02181658/Figure_12_03_04.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a pair of homologous chromosomes.

The other two chromosomes are non-recombinant and have the same arrangement of genes as before meiosis." width="400" height="604" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02181658/Figure_12_03_04.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02181658/Figure_12_03_04-199x300.jpg 199w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02181658/Figure_12_03_04-65x98.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02181658/Figure_12_03_04-225x340.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02181658/Figure_12_03_04-350x529.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 10. The process of crossover, or recombination, occurs when two homologous chromosomes align during meiosis and exchange a segment of genetic material. Here, the alleles for gene C were exchanged. The result is two recombinant and two non-recombinant chromosomes.</p> </div> <p>When two genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome, they are considered linked, and their alleles tend to be transmitted through meiosis together. To exemplify this, imagine a dihybrid cross involving flower color and plant height in which the genes are next to each other on the chromosome. If one homologous chromosome has alleles for tall plants and red flowers, and the other chromosome has genes for short plants and yellow flowers, then when the gametes are formed, the tall and red alleles will go together into a gamete and the short and yellow alleles will go into other gametes. These are called the parental genotypes because they have been inherited intact from the parents of the individual producing gametes. But unlike if the genes were on different chromosomes, there will be no gametes with tall and yellow alleles and no gametes with short and red alleles. If you create the Punnett square with these gametes, you will see that the classical Mendelian prediction of a 9:3:3:1 outcome of a dihybrid cross would not apply. As the distance between two genes increases, the probability of one or more crossovers between them increases, and the genes behave more like they are on separate chromosomes. Geneticists have used the proportion of recombinant gametes (the ones not like the parents) as a measure of how far apart genes are on a chromosome. Using this information, they have constructed elaborate maps of genes on chromosomes for well-studied organisms, including humans.</p> <p>Mendel’s seminal publication makes no mention of linkage, and many researchers have questioned whether he encountered linkage but chose not to publish those crosses out of concern that they would invalidate his independent assortment postulate. The garden pea has seven chromosomes, and some have suggested that his choice of seven characteristics was not a coincidence. However, even if the genes he examined were not located on separate chromosomes, it is possible that he simply did not observe linkage because of the extensive shuffling effects of recombination.</p> <div class="textbox examples"><h3>Testing the Hypothesis of Independent Assortment</h3> <p>To better appreciate the amount of labor and ingenuity that went into Mendel’s experiments, proceed through one of Mendel’s dihybrid crosses.</p> <p><strong>Question: </strong>What will be the offspring of a dihybrid cross?</p> <p><strong>Background: </strong>Consider that pea plants mature in one growing season, and you have access to a large garden in which you can cultivate thousands of pea plants. There are several true-breeding plants with the following pairs of traits: tall plants with inflated pods, and dwarf plants with constricted pods. Before the plants have matured, you remove the pollen-producing organs from the tall/inflated plants in your crosses to prevent self-fertilization. Upon plant maturation, the plants are manually crossed by transferring pollen from the dwarf/constricted plants to the stigmata of the tall/inflated plants.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis: </strong>Both trait pairs will sort independently according to Mendelian laws. When the true-breeding parents are crossed, all of the F<sub>1</sub> offspring are tall and have inflated pods, which indicates that the tall and inflated traits are dominant over the dwarf and constricted traits, respectively. A self-cross of the F<sub>1</sub> heterozygotes results in 2,000 F<sub>2</sub> progeny.</p> <p><strong>Test the hypothesis: </strong>Because each trait pair sorts independently, the ratios of tall:dwarf and inflated:constricted are each expected to be 3:1. The tall/dwarf trait pair is called <em>T/t</em>, and the inflated/constricted trait pair is designated <em>I/i</em>. Each member of the F<sub>1</sub> generation therefore has a genotype of <em>TtIi</em>. Construct a grid analogous to Figure 11, in which you cross two <em>TtIi</em> individuals. Each individual can donate four combinations of two traits: <em>TI</em>, <em>Ti</em>, <em>tI</em>, or <em>ti</em>, meaning that there are 16 possibilities of offspring genotypes. Because the <em>T</em> and <em>I</em> alleles are dominant, any individual having one or two of those alleles will express the tall or inflated phenotypes, respectively, regardless if they also have a <em>t</em> or <em>i</em> allele. Only individuals that are <em>tt</em> or <em>ii</em> will express the dwarf and constricted alleles, respectively.

Observable traits are referred to as dominant, and non-expressed traits are described as recessive. When the offspring in Mendel’s experiment were self-crossed, the F<sub>2</sub> offspring exhibited the dominant trait or the recessive trait in a 3:1 ratio, confirming that the recessive trait had been transmitted faithfully from the original P<sub>0</sub> parent. Reciprocal crosses generated identical F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> offspring ratios. By examining large sample sizes, Mendel showed that his crosses behaved reproducibly according to the laws of probability, and that the traits were inherited as independent events.</p> <p>Two rules in probability can be used to find the expected proportions of offspring of different traits from different crosses. To find the probability of two or more independent events occurring together, apply the product rule and multiply the probabilities of the individual events. The use of the word “and” suggests the appropriate application of the product rule. To find the probability of two or more events occurring in combination, apply the sum rule and add their individual probabilities together. The use of the word “or” suggests the appropriate application of the sum rule.</p> <p>When true-breeding or homozygous individuals that differ for a certain trait are crossed, all of the offspring will be heterozygotes for that trait. If the traits are inherited as dominant and recessive, the F<sub>1</sub> offspring will all exhibit the same phenotype as the parent homozygous for the dominant trait. If these heterozygous offspring are self-crossed, the resulting F<sub>2</sub> offspring will be equally likely to inherit gametes carrying the dominant or recessive trait, giving rise to offspring of which one quarter are homozygous dominant, half are heterozygous, and one quarter are homozygous recessive. Because homozygous dominant and heterozygous individuals are phenotypically identical, the observed traits in the F<sub>2</sub> offspring will exhibit a ratio of three dominant to one recessive.</p> <p>Mendel postulated that genes (characteristics) are inherited as pairs of alleles (traits) that behave in a dominant and recessive pattern. Alleles segregate into gametes such that each gamete is equally likely to receive either one of the two alleles present in a diploid individual. In addition, genes are assorted into gametes independently of one another. That is, alleles are generally not more likely to segregate into a gamete with a particular allele of another gene. A dihybrid cross demonstrates independent assortment when the genes in question are on different chromosomes or distant from each other on the same chromosome. For crosses involving more than two genes, use the forked line or probability methods to predict offspring genotypes and phenotypes rather than a Punnett square.</p> <p>Although chromosomes sort independently into gametes during meiosis, Mendel’s law of independent assortment refers to genes, not chromosomes, and a single chromosome may carry more than 1,000 genes. When genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome, their alleles tend to be inherited together. This results in offspring ratios that violate Mendel’s law of independent assortment. However, recombination serves to exchange genetic material on homologous chromosomes such that maternal and paternal alleles may be recombined on the same chromosome. This is why alleles on a given chromosome are not always inherited together. Recombination is a random event occurring anywhere on a chromosome. Therefore, genes that are far apart on the same chromosome are likely to still assort independently because of recombination events that occurred in the intervening chromosomal space.</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

These pink flowers of a heterozygote snapdragon result from incomplete dominance. (credit: “storebukkebruse”/Flickr)</p> </div> <p>Mendel’s results, that traits are inherited as dominant and recessive pairs, contradicted the view at that time that offspring exhibited a blend of their parents’ traits. However, the heterozygote phenotype occasionally does appear to be intermediate between the two parents. For example, in the snapdragon, <em>Antirrhinum majus</em> (Figure&nbsp;1), a cross between a homozygous parent with white flowers (<em>C<i><sup>W</sup></i>C<i><sup>W</sup></i></em>) and a homozygous parent with red flowers (<em>C<i><sup>R</sup></i>C<i><sup>R</sup></i></em>) will produce offspring with pink flowers (<em>C<i><sup>R</sup></i>C<i><sup>W</sup></i></em>). (Note that different genotypic abbreviations are used for Mendelian extensions to distinguish these patterns from simple dominance and recessiveness.) This pattern of inheritance is described as <strong>incomplete dominance</strong>, denoting the expression of two contrasting alleles such that the individual displays an intermediate phenotype. The allele for red flowers is incompletely dominant over the allele for white flowers. However, the results of a heterozygote self-cross can still be predicted, just as with Mendelian dominant and recessive crosses. In this case, the genotypic ratio would be 1 <em>C<i><sup>R</sup></i>C<i><sup>R</sup></i></em>:2 <em>C<i><sup>R</sup></i>C<i><sup>W</sup></i></em>:1 <em>C<i><sup>W</sup></i>C<i><sup>W</sup></i></em>, and the phenotypic ratio would be 1:2:1 for red:pink:white.</p> <p>Incomplete dominance can be seen in several types of flowers, including pink tulips, carnations and roses—any pink flowers in these are due to the mixing of red and white alleles. Incomplete dominance can also be observed in some animals, such as rabbits. When a long-furred Angora breeds with a short-furred Rex, the offspring have medium-length fur. Tail length in dogs is similarly impacted by genes that display incomplete dominance patterns.</p> <h2>Codominant Inheritance</h2> <div id="attachment_4144" style="width: 359px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-4144" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/16194026/Red_roan_Quarter_Horse.jpg" alt="A horse with red roan coloring." width="349" height="261" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/16194026/Red_roan_Quarter_Horse.jpg 800w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/16194026/Red_roan_Quarter_Horse-300x224.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/16194026/Red_roan_Quarter_Horse-768x574.jpg 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/16194026/Red_roan_Quarter_Horse-65x49.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/16194026/Red_roan_Quarter_Horse-225x168.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/16194026/Red_roan_Quarter_Horse-350x262.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure&nbsp;2. Red Roan Horse</p> </div> <p>A variation on incomplete dominance is&nbsp;<strong>codominance</strong>, in which both alleles for the same characteristic are simultaneously expressed in the heterozygote. An example of codominance is the MN blood groups of humans. The M and N alleles are expressed in the form of an M or N antigen present on the surface of red blood cells. Homozygotes (<em>L<i><sup>M</sup></i>L<i><sup>M</sup></i></em> and <em>L<i><sup>N</sup></i>L<i><sup>N</sup></i></em>) express either the M or the N allele, and heterozygotes (<em>L<i><sup>M</sup></i>L<i><sup>N</sup></i></em>) express both alleles equally. In a self-cross between heterozygotes expressing a codominant trait, the three possible offspring genotypes are phenotypically distinct. However, the 1:2:1 genotypic ratio characteristic of a Mendelian monohybrid cross still applies.</p> <p>Codominance can also be seen in human blood types: the AB blood type is a result of both the&nbsp;<em>I<sup>A</sup></em> allele and the&nbsp;<em>I<sup>B</sup></em> allele being codominant. The roan coat color in horses is also an example of codominance. A&nbsp;“red” roan results from the mating of a chestnut parent and a white parent (Figure&nbsp;2).

<h2>Sex-Linked Traits</h2>
<p>In humans, as well as in many other animals and some plants, the sex of the individual is determined by sex chromosomes. The sex chromosomes are one pair of non-homologous chromosomes. Until now, we have only considered inheritance patterns among non-sex chromosomes, or&nbsp;<strong>autosomes</strong>. In addition to 22 homologous pairs of autosomes, human females have a homologous pair of X chromosomes, whereas human males have an XY chromosome pair. Although the Y chromosome contains a small region of similarity to the X chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis, the Y chromosome is much shorter and contains many fewer genes. When a gene being examined is present on the X chromosome, but not on the Y chromosome, it is said to be <strong>X-linked</strong>.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3. In Drosophila, the gene for eye color is located on the X chromosome. Clockwise from top left are brown, cinnabar, sepia, vermilion, white, and red. Red eye color is wild-type and is dominant to white eye color.</p>
</div>
<p>Eye color in <em>Drosophila</em> was one of the first X-linked traits to be identified. Thomas Hunt Morgan mapped this trait to the X chromosome in 1910. Like humans, <em>Drosophila</em> males have an XY chromosome pair, and females are XX. In flies, the wild-type eye color is red (X<em><sup>W</sup></em>) and it is dominant to white eye color (X<em><sup>w</sup></em>) (Figure 3). Because of the location of the eye-color gene, reciprocal crosses do not produce the same offspring ratios. Males are said to be <strong>hemizygous</strong>, because they have only one allele for any X-linked characteristic. Hemizygosity makes the descriptions of dominance and recessiveness irrelevant for XY males. <em>Drosophila</em> males lack a second allele copy on the Y chromosome; that is, their genotype can only be X<em><sup>W</sup></em>Y or X<em><sup>w</sup></em>Y. In contrast, females have two allele copies of this gene and can be X<em><sup>W</sup></em>X<em><sup>W</sup></em>, X<em><sup>W</sup></em>X<em><sup>w</sup></em>, or X<em><sup>w</sup></em>X<em><sup>w</sup></em>.</p>
<p>In an X-linked cross, the genotypes of F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> offspring depend on whether the recessive trait was expressed by the male or the female in the P<sub>0</sub> generation. With regard to&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em> eye color, when the P<sub>0</sub> male expresses the white-eye phenotype and the female is homozygous red-eyed, all members of the F<sub>1</sub> generation exhibit red eyes. The F<sub>1</sub> females are heterozygous (X<em><sup>W</sup></em>X<em><sup>w</sup></em>), and the males are all X<em><sup>W</sup></em>Y, having received their X chromosome from the homozygous dominant P<sub>0</sub> female and their Y chromosome from the P<sub>0</sub> male. A subsequent cross between the X<em><sup>W</sup></em>X<em><sup>w</sup></em> female and the X<em><sup>W</sup></em>Y male would produce only red-eyed females (with X<em><sup>W</sup></em>X<em><sup>W</sup></em> or X<em><sup>W</sup></em>X<em><sup>w</sup></em> genotypes) and both red- and white-eyed males (with X<em><sup>W</sup></em>Y or X<em><sup>w</sup></em>Y genotypes). Now, consider a cross between a homozygous white-eyed female and a male with red eyes (Figure 4). The F<sub>1</sub> generation would exhibit only heterozygous red-eyed females (X<em><sup>W</sup></em>X<em><sup>w</sup></em>) and only white-eyed males (X<em><sup>w</sup></em>Y). Half of the F<sub>2</sub> females would be red-eyed (X<em><sup>W</sup></em>X<em><sup>w</sup></em>) and half would be white-eyed (X<em><sup>w</sup></em>X<em><sup>w</sup></em>). Similarly, half of the F<sub>2</sub> males would be red-eyed (X<em><sup>W</sup></em>Y) and half would be white-eyed (X<em><sup>w</sup></em>Y).</p>

When a female parent is homozygous for a recessive X-linked trait, she will pass the trait on to 100 percent of her offspring. Her male offspring are, therefore, destined to express the trait, as they will inherit their father’s Y chromosome. In humans, the alleles for certain conditions (some forms of color blindness, hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy) are X-linked. Females who are heterozygous for these diseases are said to be carriers and may not exhibit any phenotypic effects. These females will pass the disease to half of their sons and will pass carrier status to half of their daughters; therefore, recessive X-linked traits appear more frequently in males than females.</p> <p>In some groups of organisms with sex chromosomes, the gender with the non-homologous sex chromosomes is the female rather than the male. This is the case for all birds. In this case, sex-linked traits will be more likely to appear in the female, in which they are hemizygous.</p> <h2>Non-Mendelian Punnett Squares</h2> <p>This practice activity will help you remember the difference between types of non-Mendelian inheritance and remember just how they work.</p> <p></p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

We now know that this is an oversimplification. Although individual humans (and all diploid organisms) can only have two alleles for a given gene, multiple alleles may exist at the population level such that many combinations of two alleles are observed. Note that when many alleles exist for the same gene, the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the&nbsp;<strong>wild type</strong> (often abbreviated “+”); this is considered the standard or norm. All other phenotypes or genotypes are considered <strong>variants</strong> of this standard, meaning that they deviate from the wild type. The variant may be recessive or dominant to the wild-type allele.</p> <p>An example of multiple alleles is coat color in rabbits (Figure 5). Here, four alleles exist for the&nbsp;<em>c</em> gene. The wild-type version, <em>C<sup data-redactor-tag="sup">+</sup>C<sup>+</sup></em>, is expressed as brown fur. The chinchilla phenotype, <em>c<i data-redactor-tag="i"><sup>ch</sup></i>c<i><sup data-redactor-tag="sup">ch</sup></i></em>, is expressed as black-tipped white fur. The Himalayan phenotype, <em>c<i data-redactor-tag="i"><sup>h</sup></i>c<i><sup data-redactor-tag="sup">h</sup></i></em>, has black fur on the extremities and white fur elsewhere. Finally, the albino, or “colorless” phenotype, <em>cc</em>, is expressed as white fur. In cases of multiple alleles, dominance hierarchies can exist. In this case, the wild-type allele is dominant over all the others, chinchilla is incompletely dominant over Himalayan and albino, and Himalayan is dominant over albino. This hierarchy, or allelic series, was revealed by observing the phenotypes of each possible heterozygote offspring.</p> <div id="attachment_1412" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1412" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02182457/Figure_12_02_05.jpg" alt="This illustration shows the four different variants for coat color in rabbits at the c allele.

As seen in comparing the wild-type <i>Drosophila</i> (left) and the <i>Antennapedia</i> mutant (right), the Antennapedia mutant has legs on its head in place of antennae.</p> </div> <p>The complete dominance of a wild-type phenotype over all other mutants often occurs as an effect of “dosage” of a specific gene product, such that the wild-type allele supplies the correct amount of gene product whereas the mutant alleles cannot. For the allelic series in rabbits, the wild-type allele may supply a given dosage of fur pigment, whereas the mutants supply a lesser dosage or none at all. Interestingly, the Himalayan phenotype is the result of an allele that produces a temperature-sensitive gene product that only produces pigment in the cooler extremities of the rabbit’s body.</p> <p>Alternatively, one mutant allele can be dominant over all other phenotypes, including the wild type. This may occur when the mutant allele somehow interferes with the genetic message so that even a heterozygote with one wild-type allele copy expresses the mutant phenotype. One way in which the mutant allele can interfere is by enhancing the function of the wild-type gene product or changing its distribution in the body.</p> <p>One example of this is the <em>Antennapedia</em> mutation in <em>Drosophila</em> (Figure 6). In this case, the mutant allele expands the distribution of the gene product, and as a result, the <em>Antennapedia</em> heterozygote develops legs on its head where its antennae should be.</p> <div class="key-takeaways textbox"><h3>Multiple Alleles Confer Drug Resistance in the Malaria Parasite</h3> <p>Malaria is a parasitic disease in humans that is transmitted by infected female mosquitoes, including&nbsp;<em>Anopheles gambiae</em> (Figure 7a), and is characterized by cyclic high fevers, chills, flu-like symptoms, and severe anemia. <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> and <em>P. vivax</em> are the most common causative agents of malaria, and <em>P. falciparum</em> is the most deadly (Figure 7b)<em>.</em> When promptly and correctly treated, <em>P. falciparum</em>malaria has a mortality rate of 0.1 percent. However, in some parts of the world, the parasite has evolved resistance to commonly used malaria treatments, so the most effective malarial treatments can vary by geographic region.</p> <div id="attachment_1414" style="width: 979px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1414" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02182928/Figure_12_02_07.jpg" alt="Photo a shows the Anopheles gambiae mosquito, which carries malaria.

Gathany; credit b: Ute Frevert; false color by Margaret Shear; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)</p> </div> <p>In Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America,&nbsp;<em>P. falciparum</em> has developed resistance to the anti-malarial drugs chloroquine, mefloquine, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. <em>P. falciparum</em>, which is haploid during the life stage in which it is infectious to humans, has evolved multiple drug-resistant mutant alleles of the&nbsp;<em>dhps</em> gene. Varying degrees of sulfadoxine resistance are associated with each of these alleles. Being haploid, <em>P. falciparum</em> needs only one drug-resistant allele to express this trait.</p> <p>In Southeast Asia, different sulfadoxine-resistant alleles of the&nbsp;<em>dhps</em> gene are localized to different geographic regions. This is a common evolutionary phenomenon that occurs because drug-resistant mutants arise in a population and interbreed with other <em>P. falciparum</em> isolates in close proximity. Sulfadoxine-resistant parasites cause considerable human hardship in regions where this drug is widely used as an over-the-counter malaria remedy. As is common with pathogens that multiply to large numbers within an infection cycle, <em>P. falciparum</em> evolves relatively rapidly (over a decade or so) in response to the selective pressure of commonly used anti-malarial drugs. For this reason, scientists must constantly work to develop new drugs or drug combinations to combat the worldwide malaria burden.<span class="footnote">Sumiti Vinayak, et al., "Origin and Evolution of Sulfadoxine Resistant&nbsp;<em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>," <em>Public Library of Science Pathogens</em> 6, no. 3 (2010): e1000830, doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000830.</span></p> </div> <h3>Multiple Alleles (ABO Blood Types) and Punnett Squares</h3> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9O5JQqlngFY/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &quot;Multiple Alleles (ABO Blood Types) and Punnett Squares&quot;" title="Multiple Alleles (ABO Blood Types) and Punnett Squares" /> <p>A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

In some cases, despite the presence of a dominant allele, a phenotype may not be present. One example of this is polydactyly in humans (extra fingers and/or toes). A dominant allele produces polydactyly in humans but not all humans with the allele display the extra digits. “Complete” penetrance means the gene or genes for a trait are expressed in all the population who have the genes. “Incomplete” or ‘reduced’ penetrance means the genetic trait is expressed in only part of the population. The penetrance of expression may also change in different age groups of a population. Reduced penetrance probably results from a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, many of which are unknown. This phenomenon can make it challenging for genetics professionals to interpret a person’s family medical history and predict the risk of passing a genetic condition to future generations.</p> <div id="attachment_2935" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2935 size-large" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/15205138/penetrance-1024x282.png" alt="Complete penetrance: all six squares are dark green.

Back to the polydactyly example, an extra digit may occur on one or more appendages. The digit can be full size or just a stub. Hence, this allele has reduced penetrance as well as variable expressivity. Variable expressivity refers to the range of signs and symptoms that can occur in different people with the same genetic condition. As with reduced penetrance, variable expressivity is probably caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, most of which have not been identified.

Family history can be used as a diagnostic tool and help guide decisions about genetic testing for the patient and at-risk family members. If a family is affected by a disease, an accurate family history will be important to establish a pattern of transmission. In addition, a family history can even help to exclude genetic diseases, particularly for common diseases in which lifestyle and environment play strong roles. Lastly, a family history can identify potential health problems that an individual may be at increased risk for in the future. Early identification of increased risk can allow the individual and health professional to take steps to reduce risk by implementing lifestyle changes and increasing disease surveillance.</p> <p>While many of the well-known genetic disorders are of childhood onset, many complex, adult-onset conditions can also run in families. For example, about 5 to 10 percent of all breast cancers are hereditary. These cancers may be caused by mutations in particular genes, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2. An individual may be at high risk of hereditary breast cancer and genetic testing should be considered if her family history includes more than one first-degree (mother, sister, or daughter) or second-degree relative (aunt, grandmother, or niece) with breast or ovarian cancer, particularly if the diagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer in those relatives was at a young age (50 or younger).</p> <p>Another example of an adult-onset disease that can be inherited is Alzheimer’s disease. Although most of Alzheimer’s disease cases are sporadic, a small number are hereditary. Hereditary Alzheimer’s disease is an extremely aggressive form of the disease and typically manifests before the age of 65. Three genes that cause early-onset Alzheimer’s disease have been identified.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the importance of family history to help define occurrence of a genetic disorder within a family, it should be noted that some genetic diseases are caused by spontaneous mutations, such as for single gene disorders like Duchenne muscular dystrophy and hemophilia A, as well as for most cases of Down syndrome, chromosomal deletion syndromes, and other chromosomal disorders. Therefore, a genetic disorder cannot be ruled out in the absence of a family history.</p> <h3>How to Take a Family Medical History</h3> <p>A basic family history should include three generations. To begin taking a family history, start by asking the patient about his/her health history and then ask about siblings and parents. Questions should include:</p> <ol><li>General information such as names and birthdates</li> <li>Family’s origin or racial/ethnic background</li> <li>Health status</li> <li>Age at death and cause of death of each family member</li> <li>Pregnancy outcomes of the patient and genetically-related relatives It may be easier to list all the members of the nuclear family first and then go back and ask about the health status of each one. After you have taken the family history of the patient’s closest relatives, go back one generation at a time and ask about aunts, uncles, grandparents, and first cousins.</li> </ol> <h3>Pedigrees</h3> <p>One way to record a family history is by drawing a family tree called a “pedigree.” A pedigree represents family members and relationships using standardized symbols (see below). As patients relate information to you about their family history, a pedigree can be drawn much quicker than recording the information in writing and allows patterns of disease to emerge as the pedigree is drawn. Since the family history is continually changing, the pedigree can be easily updated on future visits. Patients should be encouraged to record information and update their family history regularly.</p> <div class="wp-nocaption aligncenter wp-image-2919 size-full"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2919 size-full" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/15202006/ch3diagram1.jpg" alt="A Chart indicating common symbols on pedigree charts.

In this outcome, we’ll learn about a few different ways our environment can impact us.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>Learning Objectives</h3> <ul><li>Explain how epistasis impacts trait expression</li> <li>Describe polygenic inheritance and how to recognize it</li> <li>Describe continuous variation and how to recognize it</li> <li>Identify gene-environment interaction and how this impacts trait expression</li> <li>Explain pleiotropy and its impact on traits in a population</li> </ul> </div> <h2>Epistasis</h2> <p>Mendel’s studies in pea plants implied that the sum of an individual’s phenotype was controlled by genes (or as he called them, unit factors), such that every characteristic was distinctly and completely controlled by a single gene. In fact, single observable characteristics are almost always under the influence of multiple genes (each with two or more alleles) acting in unison. For example, at least eight genes contribute to eye color in humans.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">Eye color in humans is determined by multiple genes. Use the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.athro.com/evo/inherit.html" target="_blank">Eye Color Calculator</a> to predict the eye color of children from parental eye color.</div> <p>In some cases, several genes can contribute to aspects of a common phenotype without their gene products ever directly interacting. In the case of organ development, for instance, genes may be expressed sequentially, with each gene adding to the complexity and specificity of the organ. Genes may function in complementary or synergistic fashions, such that two or more genes need to be expressed simultaneously to affect a phenotype. Genes may also oppose each other, with one gene modifying the expression of another.</p> <p>In epistasis, the interaction between genes is antagonistic, such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of another. “Epistasis” is a word composed of Greek roots that mean “standing upon.” The alleles that are being masked or silenced are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking. Often the biochemical basis of epistasis is a gene pathway in which the expression of one gene is dependent on the function of a gene that precedes or follows it in the pathway.</p> <p>An example of epistasis is pigmentation in mice. The wild-type coat color, agouti (<em>AA</em>), is dominant to solid-colored fur (<em>aa</em>). However, a separate gene (<em>C</em>) is necessary for pigment production. A mouse with a recessive <em>c</em> allele at this locus is unable to produce pigment and is albino regardless of the allele present at locus <em>A</em> (Figure 1). Therefore, the genotypes <em>AAcc</em>, <em>Aacc</em>, and <em>aacc</em> all produce the same albino phenotype. A cross between heterozygotes for both genes (<em>AaCc</em> x <em>AaCc</em>) would generate offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 9 agouti:3 solid color:4 albino (Figure 1). In this case, the <em>C</em> gene is epistatic to the <em>A</em> gene.</p> <div id="attachment_1416" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1416" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02183244/Figure_12_03_05.jpg" alt="A cross between two agouti mice with the heterozygous genotype AaCc is shown.

In mice, the mottled agouti coat color (<em>A</em>) is dominant to a solid coloration, such as black or gray. A gene at a separate locus (<em>C</em>) is responsible for pigment production. The recessive <em>c</em> allele does not produce pigment, and a mouse with the homozygous recessive <em>cc</em> enotype is albino regardless of the allele present at the <em>A</em> locus. Thus, the <em>C</em> gene is epistatic to the <em>A</em> gene.</p> </div> <p>Epistasis can also occur when a dominant allele masks expression at a separate gene. Fruit color in summer squash is expressed in this way. Homozygous recessive expression of the&nbsp;<em>W</em> gene (<em>ww</em>) coupled with homozygous dominant or heterozygous expression of the <em>Y</em> gene (<em>YY</em> or <em>Yy</em>) generates yellow fruit, and the <em>wwyy</em> genotype produces green fruit. However, if a dominant copy of the <em>W</em> gene is present in the homozygous or heterozygous form, the summer squash will produce white fruit regardless of the <em>Y</em> alleles. A cross between white heterozygotes for both genes (<em>WwYy</em> × <em>WwYy</em>) would produce offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 12 white:3 yellow:1 green.</p> <p>Finally, epistasis can be reciprocal such that either gene, when present in the dominant (or recessive) form, expresses the same phenotype. In the shepherd’s purse plant (<em>Capsella bursa-pastoris</em>), the characteristic of seed shape is controlled by two genes in a dominant epistatic relationship. When the genes <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are both homozygous recessive (<em>aabb</em>), the seeds are ovoid. If the dominant allele for either of these genes is present, the result is triangular seeds. That is, every possible genotype other than <em>aabb</em> results in triangular seeds, and a cross between heterozygotes for both genes (<em>AaBb</em> x <em>AaBb</em>) would yield offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 15 triangular:1 ovoid.</p> <p>As you work through genetics problems, keep in mind that any single characteristic that results in a phenotypic ratio that totals 16 is typical of a two-gene interaction. Recall the phenotypic inheritance pattern for Mendel’s dihybrid cross, which considered two non-interacting genes—9:3:3:1. Similarly, we would expect interacting gene pairs to also exhibit ratios expressed as 16 parts. Note that we are assuming the interacting genes are not linked; they are still assorting independently into gametes.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">For an excellent review of Mendel’s experiments and to perform your own crosses and identify patterns of inheritance, visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.edc.org/weblabs/mendel/MendelMenu.html" target="_blank">Mendel’s Peas</a> web lab.</div> <p>Whether or not they are sorting independently, genes may interact at the level of gene products such that the expression of an allele for one gene masks or modifies the expression of an allele for a different gene. This is called epistasis.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">Epistasis is a form on non-Mendelian inheritance in which one gene is capable of interfering with expression of another. This is often found associated with gene pathways where the expression of one gene is directly dependent on the presence or absence of another gene product within the pathway.Watch this video for a quick review of epistasis:<br /> <script type="text/javascript" src="//static.3playmedia.com/p/projects/20361/files/1280814/plugins/11085.js"></script><script src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api" type="text/javascript"></script><br /> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

For example, consider human height. Unlike a simple Mendelian characteristic, human height displays:</p> <ul><li><strong>Continuous variation.</strong> Unlike Mendel’s pea plants, humans don’t come in two clear-cut “tall” and “short” varieties. In fact, they don’t even come in four heights, or eight, or sixteen. Instead, it’s possible to get humans of many different heights, and height can vary in increments of inches or fractions of inches. As an example, consider the bell curve-shaped graph in Figure 2, which shows the heights of a group of male high school seniors.</li> <li><strong>A complex inheritance pattern.</strong> If you’ve paid attention to the heights of your friends and family, you may have noticed that many different patterns of inheritance are possible. Tall parents can have a short child, short parents can have a tall child, and two parents of different heights may or may not have a child of intermediate height. In addition, siblings with the same two parents may have a range of heights, ones that don’t fall into clear, distinct categories. Simple models involving one or two genes can’t accurately predict all of these inheritance patterns.</li> </ul> <div id="attachment_2932" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-2932" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/06/15204204/height-1024x631.png" alt="Histogram showing height in inches of male high school seniors in a sample group.

Kimball (CC BY 3.0).</p> </div> <p>How, then, is height inherited? Height and other similar features are controlled not just by one gene, but rather, by multiple (often many) genes that each make a small contribution to the overall outcome. This inheritance pattern is called <strong>polygenic inheritance</strong> (<em>poly</em>– = many). For instance, a recent study found over 400 genes linked to variation in height<span class="footnote">Wood, A. R., Esko, T., Yang, J., Vedantam, S., Pers, T. H., Gustafsson, S., ... Frayling, T. M. (2014). Defining the role of common variation in the genomic and biological architecture of adult human height. <em>Nature Genetics</em>, <em>46</em>, 1173–1186. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.3097" target="_blank">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.3097</a>.</span>.&nbsp;When there are large numbers of genes involved, it becomes hard to distinguish the effect of each individual gene, and even harder to see that gene variants (alleles) are inherited according to Mendelian rules. In a further complication, height doesn’t just depend on genetics: it also depends a lot on environmental factors, such as a child’s overall health and the type of nutrition he or she receives while growing up.</p> <p>In this article, we’ll look in more detail at how complex human traits such as height are inherited, as well as how factors like genetic background and environment can influence the <strong>phenotype</strong> (observable features) produced by a particular <strong>genotype</strong> (set of gene variants, or alleles).</p> <h3>Polygenic Inheritance</h3> <p>Some human characteristics, such as height, eye color, and hair color, don’t come in just a few distinct forms. Instead, they vary in small gradations, forming a spectrum or continuum of possible phenotypes. Features like these are called quantitative characters, and they’re typically controlled by multiple genes (often, many genes), each of which contributes to the overall phenotype.

It’s not hard to imagine that, as we increased the number of genes involved, we’d be able to get even finer variations in color, or in another trait such as height. Real polygenic traits aren’t usually quite this clean and simple. (For instance, genes may make unequal contributions to the phenotype, alleles may or may not display incomplete dominance, and there may be non-additive interactions between genes.) However, the basic idea—that multiple genes obeying Mendelian rules can produce a spectrum of finely differing phenotypes—holds true for human traits such as skin and eye color.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>PRactice Questions</h3> <p>We’ve learned about polygenic inheritance and continuous variation.

<div id="q646463" class="hidden-answer" style="display: none"><em>Polygenic traits</em> are traits that rely on multiple genes. <em>Continuous variation</em> describes traits whose phenotypes occur on a continuum, rather than having a limited number of possible phenotypes. Traits with continuous variation are often also polygenic traits, but not always, and not all polygenic traits have continuous variation.</div>

<h2>Effect of the Environment</h2>
<p>Characteristics that are influenced by environmental as well as genetic factors are called <em>multifactorial</em>. The idea of “nature versus nurture” — in other words, the relative influence of genetics versus environmental factors — has been and still is debated. Just looking at the genes of a given organism will not determine how that organism will develop and act. Even identical twins will show different characteristics, depending on the environment in which they live. Everyone is a product of their environment as well as their genetics.</p>
<p>Even when influenced by the environment, phenotypes have a normal range of expression. For instance, human height varies based on nutrition and genetics, but not many people are shorter than 4½ feet or taller than 7 feet. The range of phenotypic possibilities is called the <em>norm of reaction</em>. Hydrangeas, for example, may be blue, pink, or purple, but they are never naturally orange. Hydrangeas are blue in acidic soil with available aluminum, and they are pink in alkaline soil without available aluminum.</p>
<p>Some human characteristics have a narrow norm of reaction, such as blood type. Others have a wide norm of reaction, such as the number of blood cells in humans, which varies depending on factors that include physical fitness, presence or history of infections, and even the altitude at which a person lives.</p>

<p>The environment also affects human genes. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter that acts inside brain cells, lowers anxiety and depression during traumatic times. Mutations in the serotonin transporter gene may cause a reduced ability to cope with stress. That does not mean that the person is always depressed, but if the environment produces stress, the person may become depressed more easily than a person with unmutated serotonin transporter genes.</p>
<p>You already learned about PKU, a pleiotropic disorder caused by defects in a single gene coding for an enzyme that converts the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine. Newborns are tested for this defect very early in life (Figure 4), so that if the results are positive, they can be given a diet limiting phenylalanine ingestion. That way, the toxic buildup is prevented and the children can develop normally. PKU is an example in which environmental factors can modify gene expression.</p>

<h3>Practice Question</h3>
<p>Two identical twins (female) live in different parts of the country. One is very committed to a&nbsp;healthy lifestyle: not smoking, exercising regularly, eating a diet rich in fresh produce, and avoiding red&nbsp;meats and processed foods. The other is not as careful: she smokes, is overweight, and often eats fast&nbsp;and processed foods. They are aware that several women in their family have had breast cancer, and&nbsp;decide to consult a doctor about their odds of developing the disease. Which of the following statements&nbsp;by the doctor sounds most correct?</p>
<ol>
<li>As identical twins, you are genetically the same, so your chances of developing breast cancer are identical.</li>
<li>The twin with the healthy lifestyle should not be terribly concerned, while the one with the unhealthy lifestyle is at a higher risk.</li>
<li>Breast cancer has a genetic component, and the twins have identical genes, so they have the same genetic risk. However, environmental factors such as smoking, obesity, and consumption of red meat have been shown to increase the risk of cancer. While both twins should monitor themselves closely, the twin who smokes and is overweight may want to consider a healthier lifestyle to decrease her risk of breast cancer.</li>

Option two is also wrong; familial cancers have a genetic component which may or may not be balanced by a healthy lifestyle. Option three is the most correct answer; lifestyle choices are important, but genetic influences are to be taken seriously, especially if&nbsp;there is a family pattern associated with them.</div> </div> </div> <p>While genes and genetic causes play a large role in health and phenotypes, the environment also plays an important role. Understanding this can enable the treatment of some disorders, such as the case with PKU in which limiting the intake of phenylalanine can prevent toxic build up of this amino acid. Often the norm of reaction is set by genetic factors but ultimately determined by environmental exposures.</p> <h2>Pleiotropy and Human Disorders</h2> <p>Based on Mendel’s experiments, you might imagine that all genes control a single characteristic, are present in two copies, and affect some harmless aspect of an organism’s appearance (such as color, height, or shape). Although those predictions are accurate in many cases, there are also some important exceptions. For instance, how can we explain observations like the following?</p> <ul><li>The genetic disorder Marfan syndrome is caused by a mutation in one gene, yet it affects many aspects of growth and development, including height, vision, and heart function.</li> </ul> <p>To understand observations like these, we need to look more deeply at what genes are. Rather than abstract “heritable factors,” genes are stretches of DNA found on chromosomes, and most of them encode (specify the sequence of) proteins that do a certain job in the cell or body. In this article, we’ll look in more detail at genes affecting multiple characteristics (pleiotropy).</p> <h3>Pleiotropy</h3> <p>When we discussed Mendel’s experiments with purple-flowered and white-flowered plants, we didn’t mention any other phenotypes associated with the two flower colors. However, Mendel noticed that the flower colors were always correlated with two other features: the color of the seed coat (covering of the seed) and the color of the axils (junctions where the leaves met the main stem)<span class="footnote">Lobo, I.

We now know that Mendel’s flower color gene encodes a regulator protein that activates pigment biosynthesis, and that it works in several different parts of the pea plant (flowers, seed coat, and leaf axils). Thus, the seemingly unrelated phenotypes can all be traced back to a defect in a single gene with several jobs.</p> <p>Importantly, alleles of pleiotropic genes are transmitted in the same way as alleles of genes that affect single traits. Although the phenotype has multiple elements, these elements are specified as a package, and the dominant and recessive versions of the package would appear in the progeny of a monohybrid cross in a ratio of&nbsp;3:1.</p> <h3>Pleiotropy in Human Genetic Disorders</h3> <p>Genes affected in human genetic disorders are often pleiotropic.

All of this is in addition to the complications brought about by environmental influences and random genetic mutations or damage.

They do not screen for disorders arising from dominant gene mutations, as these cannot be prevented by informed mate selection.

It&#8217;s just the same old flu virus right? How much could it change from year to year?</p> <p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not just the same old flu virus—and it often changes a lot from year to year. When the flu vaccine does its work, killing the current iteration of the flu, it typically does a good job and saves its host from illness. However, as it wipes out the majority of flu viruses, the only ones that are left are those that are resistant to the current virus, which means the overall make up of the population of flu viruses has changed: the population has evolved to become resistant to one anti-viral treatment, so another must be found.</p> <p>Of course, while the theory of evolution can be applied to viruses, it is more often discussed in the context of living things: bacteria, plants, animals, and even humans. The theory of evolution began as a revolutionary idea, but it remains central to the study of biology. Evolution is the unifying concept in biology. This theory documents the change in the genetic makeup of a biological population over time. Evolution helps us understand the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria and other parasitic organisms.

Darwin observed that beak shape varies among finch species. He postulated that the beak of an ancestral species had adapted over time to equip the finches to acquire different food sources.</p> </div> <p>In the mid-nineteenth century, the actual mechanism for evolution was independently conceived of and described by two naturalists: Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. Importantly, each naturalist spent time exploring the natural world on expeditions to the tropics. From 1831 to 1836, Darwin traveled around the world on&nbsp;<em>H.M.S. Beagle</em>, including stops in South America, Australia, and the southern tip of Africa. Wallace traveled to Brazil to collect insects in the Amazon rainforest from 1848 to 1852 and to the Malay Archipelago from 1854 to 1862. Darwin’s journey, like Wallace’s later journeys to the Malay Archipelago, included stops at several island chains, the last being the Galápagos Islands west of Ecuador. On these islands, Darwin observed species of organisms on different islands that were clearly similar, yet had distinct differences. For example, the ground finches inhabiting the Galápagos Islands comprised several species with a unique beak shape (Figure 1).</p> <p>The species on the islands had a graded series of beak sizes and shapes with very small differences between the most similar. He observed that these finches closely resembled another finch species on the mainland of South America. Darwin imagined that the island species might be species modified from one of the original mainland species. Upon further study, he realized that the varied beaks of each finch helped the birds acquire a specific type of food. For example, seed-eating finches had stronger, thicker beaks for breaking seeds, and insect-eating finches had spear-like beaks for stabbing their prey.</p> <p>Wallace and Darwin both observed similar patterns in other organisms and they independently developed the same explanation for how and why such changes could take place. Darwin called this mechanism natural selection.&nbsp;<strong>Natural selection</strong>, also known as “survival of the fittest,” is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits; this leads to evolutionary change.</p> <p>For example, a population of giant tortoises found in the Galapagos Archipelago was observed by Darwin to have longer necks than those that lived on other islands with dry lowlands. These tortoises were “selected” because they could reach more leaves and access more food than those with short necks. In times of drought when fewer leaves would be available, those that could reach more leaves had a better chance to eat and survive than those that couldn’t reach the food source. Consequently, long-necked tortoises would be more likely to be reproductively successful and pass the long-necked trait to their offspring. Over time, only long-necked tortoises would be present in the population.</p> <p>Natural selection, Darwin argued, was an inevitable outcome of three principles that operated in nature. First, most characteristics of organisms are inherited, or passed from parent to offspring. Although no one, including Darwin and Wallace, knew how this happened at the time, it was a common understanding. Second, more offspring are produced than are able to survive, so resources for survival and reproduction are limited. The capacity for reproduction in all organisms outstrips the availability of resources to support their numbers. Thus, there is competition for those resources in each generation. Both Darwin and Wallace’s understanding of this principle came from reading an essay by the economist Thomas Malthus who discussed this principle in relation to human populations. Third, offspring vary among each other in regard to their characteristics and those variations are inherited. Darwin and Wallace reasoned that offspring with inherited characteristics which allow them to best compete for limited resources will survive and have more offspring than those individuals with variations that are less able to compete. Because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better represented in the next generation. This will lead to change in populations over generations in a process that Darwin called descent with modification. Ultimately, natural selection leads to greater adaptation of the population to its local environment; it is the only mechanism known for adaptive evolution.</p> <p>Papers by Darwin and Wallace (Figure 2) presenting the idea of natural selection were read together in 1858 before the Linnean Society in London. The following year Darwin’s book,&nbsp;<em>On the Origin of Species, </em>was published.&nbsp;His book outlined in considerable detail his arguments for gradual changes and adaptive survival by natural selection.</p> <div id="attachment_1466" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1466" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191726/Figure_18_01_02ab.jpg" alt="Paintings of Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace are shown." width="800" height="541" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191726/Figure_18_01_02ab.jpg 800w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191726/Figure_18_01_02ab-300x203.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191726/Figure_18_01_02ab-768x519.jpg 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191726/Figure_18_01_02ab-65x44.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191726/Figure_18_01_02ab-225x152.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191726/Figure_18_01_02ab-350x237.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2. Both (a) Charles Darwin and (b) Alfred Wallace wrote scientific papers on natural selection that were presented together before the Linnean Society in 1858.</p> </div> <p>Demonstrations of evolution by natural selection are time consuming and difficult to obtain. One of the best examples has been demonstrated in the very birds that helped to inspire Darwin’s theory: the Galápagos finches. Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues have studied Galápagos finch populations every year since 1976 and have provided important demonstrations of natural selection. The Grants found changes from one generation to the next in the distribution of beak shapes with the medium ground finch on the Galápagos island of Daphne Major. The birds have inherited variation in the bill shape with some birds having wide deep bills and others having thinner bills. During a period in which rainfall was higher than normal because of an El Niño, the large hard seeds that large-billed birds ate were reduced in number; however, there was an abundance of the small soft seeds which the small-billed birds ate. Therefore, survival and reproduction were much better in the following years for the small-billed birds. In the years following this El Niño, the Grants measured beak sizes in the population and found that the average bill size was smaller. Since bill size is an inherited trait, parents with smaller bills had more offspring and the size of bills had evolved to be smaller. As conditions improved in 1987 and larger seeds became more available, the trend toward smaller average bill size ceased.</p> <h2>The Theory of Evolution</h2> <p>Natural selection can only take place if there is&nbsp;<strong>variation</strong>, or differences, among individuals in a population. Importantly, these differences must have some genetic basis; otherwise, the selection will not lead to change in the next generation. This is critical because variation among individuals can be caused by non-genetic reasons such as an individual being taller because of better nutrition rather than different genes.</p> <p>Genetic diversity in a population comes from two main mechanisms: mutation and sexual reproduction. Mutation, a change in DNA, is the ultimate source of new alleles, or new genetic variation in any population. The genetic changes caused by mutation can have one of three outcomes on the phenotype. A mutation affects the phenotype of the organism in a way that gives it reduced fitness—lower likelihood of survival or fewer offspring. A mutation may produce a phenotype with a beneficial effect on fitness. And, many mutations will also have no effect on the fitness of the phenotype; these are called neutral mutations. Mutations may also have a whole range of effect sizes on the fitness of the organism that expresses them in their phenotype, from a small effect to a great effect. Sexual reproduction also leads to genetic diversity: when two parents reproduce, unique combinations of alleles assemble to produce the unique genotypes and thus phenotypes in each of the offspring.</p> <p>A heritable trait that helps the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an&nbsp;<strong>adaptation</strong>. Scientists describe groups of organisms becoming adapted to their environment when a change in the range of genetic variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the “fit” of the population to its environment. The webbed feet of platypuses are an adaptation for swimming. The snow leopards’ thick fur is an adaptation for living in the cold. The cheetahs’ fast speed is an adaptation for catching prey.</p> <p>Whether or not a trait is favorable depends on the environmental conditions at the time. The same traits are not always selected because environmental conditions can change. For example, consider a species of plant that grew in a moist climate and did not need to conserve water. Large leaves were selected because they allowed the plant to obtain more energy from the sun. Large leaves require more water to maintain than small leaves, and the moist environment provided favorable conditions to support large leaves. After thousands of years, the climate changed, and the area no longer had excess water. The direction of natural selection shifted so that plants with small leaves were selected because those populations were able to conserve water to survive the new environmental conditions.</p> <p>The evolution of species has resulted in enormous variation in form and function. Sometimes, evolution gives rise to groups of organisms that become tremendously different from each other. When two species evolve in diverse directions from a common point, it is called divergent evolution. Such&nbsp;<strong>divergent evolution</strong> can be seen in the forms of the reproductive organs of flowering plants which share the same basic anatomies; however, they can look very different as a result of selection in different physical environments and adaptation to different kinds of pollinators (Figure 3).</p> <div id="attachment_1468" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1468" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191856/Figure_18_01_04ab.jpg" alt="Photo showing a Dense Blazing Star (Liatrus spicata) and a Purple Coneflower (Echinacea purpurea)." width="800" height="395" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191856/Figure_18_01_04ab.jpg 800w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191856/Figure_18_01_04ab-300x148.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191856/Figure_18_01_04ab-768x379.jpg 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191856/Figure_18_01_04ab-65x32.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191856/Figure_18_01_04ab-225x111.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02191856/Figure_18_01_04ab-350x173.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3. Flowering plants evolved from a common ancestor. Notice that the (a) dense blazing star (<em>Liatrus spicata</em>) and the (b) purple coneflower (<em>Echinacea purpurea</em>) vary in appearance, yet both share a similar basic morphology. (credit a: modification of work by Drew Avery; credit b: modification of work by Cory Zanker)</p> </div> <p>In other cases, similar phenotypes evolve independently in distantly related species. For example, flight has evolved in both bats and insects, and they both have structures we refer to as wings, which are adaptations to flight. However, the wings of bats and insects have evolved from very different original structures. This phenomenon is called&nbsp;<strong>convergent evolution</strong>, where similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share a recent common ancestry. The two species came to the same function, flying, but did so separately from each other.</p> <p>These physical changes occur over enormous spans of time and help explain how evolution occurs. Natural selection acts on individual organisms, which in turn can shape an entire species. Although natural selection may work in a single generation on an individual, it can take thousands or even millions of years for the genotype of an entire species to evolve. It is over these large time spans that life on earth has changed and continues to change.</p> <h2>Natural Selection</h2> <p>This video reviews some what we’ve learned so far this page, as well as going into more depth about natural selection and how it works.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aTftyFboC_M/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &quot;Natural Selection - Crash Course Biology #14&quot;" title="Natural Selection - Crash Course Biology #14" /> <p>A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Both scientists based their hypotheses on observations of diversity among natural populations. Darwin’s work in particular focused on animals of the Galapagos islands, especially finches. Over time, the idea that species changed from natural selection pressures through “descent with modification” gave rise to the idea of evolution. Data accumulated over time, for example the long study of the Galapagos finches by the Grant research team, has supported this idea and moved it into the realm of a supported theory of biology.</p> <p>Natural selection, the driving force behind evolution, can only work if variation exists among organisms. Variation arises ultimately from genetic mutations. Diversity is further encouraged through sexual reproduction. As environments change, selective pressures shift and favor different adaptations. In this way, given thousands or millions of years, species evolve.</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

The similar construction of these appendages indicates that these organisms share a common ancestor.</p> </div> <p>Another type of evidence for evolution is the presence of structures in organisms that share the same basic form. For example, the bones in the appendages of a human, dog, bird, and whale all share the same overall construction (Figure 2) resulting from their origin in the appendages of a common ancestor. Over time, evolution led to changes in the shapes and sizes of these bones in different species, but they have maintained the same overall layout. Scientists call these synonymous parts homologous structures.</p> <p>Some structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all, and appear to be residual parts from a past common ancestor. These unused structures without function are called vestigial structures. Some&nbsp;examples of vestigial structures are wings on flightless birds, leaves on some cacti, and hind leg bones in whales.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><a href="http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/similarity_hs_01" target="_blank">Visit this&nbsp;interactive site to guess which bones structures are homologous and which are analogous, and see examples of evolutionary adaptations to illustrate these concepts.</a></div> <p>Another evidence of evolution is the convergence of form in organisms that share similar environments. For example, species of unrelated animals, such as the arctic fox and ptarmigan, living in the arctic region have been selected for seasonal white phenotypes during winter to blend with the snow and ice (Figure 3). These similarities occur not because of common ancestry, but because of similar selection pressures—the benefits of not being seen by predators.</p> <div id="attachment_1473" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1473" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192118/Figure_18_01_07ab.jpg" alt="The left photo depicts an arctic fox with white fur sleeping on white snow, and the right photo shows a ptarmigan with white plumage standing on white snow." width="800" height="517" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192118/Figure_18_01_07ab.jpg 800w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192118/Figure_18_01_07ab-300x194.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192118/Figure_18_01_07ab-768x496.jpg 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192118/Figure_18_01_07ab-65x42.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192118/Figure_18_01_07ab-225x145.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192118/Figure_18_01_07ab-350x226.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3.

(credit a: modification of work by Keith Morehouse)</p> </div> <p>Embryology, the study of the development of the anatomy of an organism to its adult form, also provides evidence of relatedness between now widely divergent groups of organisms. Mutational tweaking in the embryo can have such magnified consequences in the adult that embryo formation tends to be conserved. As a result, structures that are absent in some groups often appear in their embryonic forms and disappear by the time the adult or juvenile form is reached. For example, all vertebrate embryos, including humans, exhibit gill slits and tails at some point in their early development. These disappear in the adults of terrestrial groups but are maintained in adult forms of aquatic groups such as fish and some amphibians. Great ape embryos, including humans, have a tail structure during their development that is lost by the time of birth.</p> <h2>Biological Evidence</h2> <h3>Biogeography</h3> <p>The geographic distribution of organisms on the planet follows patterns that are best explained by evolution in conjunction with the movement of tectonic plates over geological time. Broad groups that evolved before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea (about 200 million years ago) are distributed worldwide. Groups that evolved since the breakup appear uniquely in regions of the planet, such as the unique flora and fauna of northern continents that formed from the supercontinent Laurasia and of the southern continents that formed from the supercontinent Gondwana. The presence of members of the plant family Proteaceae in Australia, southern Africa, and South America is best due to&nbsp;their appearance&nbsp;prior to the southern supercontinent Gondwana breaking up.</p> <p>The great diversification of marsupials in Australia and the absence of other mammals reflect Australia’s long isolation. Australia has an abundance of endemic species—species found nowhere else—which is typical of islands whose isolation by expanses of water prevents species migration. Over time, these species diverge evolutionarily into new species that look very different from their ancestors that may exist on the mainland. The marsupials of Australia, the finches on the Galápagos, and many species on the Hawaiian Islands are all unique to their one point of origin, yet they display distant relationships to ancestral species on mainlands.</p> <h3>Molecular Biology</h3> <p>Like anatomical structures, the structures of the molecules of life reflect descent with modification. Evidence of a common ancestor for all of life is reflected in the universality of DNA as the genetic material and in the near universality of the genetic code and the machinery of DNA replication and expression. Fundamental divisions in life between the three domains are reflected in major structural differences in otherwise conservative structures such as the components of ribosomes and the structures of membranes. In general, the relatedness of groups of organisms is reflected in the similarity of their DNA sequences—exactly the pattern that would be expected from descent and diversification from a common ancestor.</p> <p>DNA sequences have also shed light on some of the mechanisms of evolution. For example, it is clear that the evolution of new functions for proteins commonly occurs after gene duplication events that allow the free modification of one copy by mutation, selection, or drift (changes in a population’s gene pool resulting from chance), while the other&nbsp;copy continues to produce a functional protein.</p> <h2>Evolution—It’s a Thing</h2> <p>This video defines evolution and discusses several varieties of evidence&nbsp;that support the Theory of Evolution:</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P3GagfbA2vo/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &quot;Evolution: It's a Thing - Crash Course Biology #20&quot;" title="Evolution: It's a Thing - Crash Course Biology #20" /> <p>A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Nevertheless, the theory of evolution is a difficult concept and misconceptions about how it works abound.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><a href="http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/misconceptions_faq.php" target="_blank">This&nbsp;site addresses some of the main misconceptions associated with the theory of evolution.</a></div> <h3>Evolution Is Just a Theory</h3> <p>Critics of the theory of evolution dismiss its importance by purposefully confounding the everyday usage of the word “theory” with the way scientists use the word. In science, a “theory” is understood to be a body of thoroughly tested and verified explanations for a set of observations of the natural world. Scientists have a theory of the atom, a theory of gravity, and the theory of relativity, each of which describes understood facts about the world. In the same way, the theory of evolution describes facts about the living world. As such, a theory in science has survived significant efforts to discredit it by scientists. In contrast, a “theory” in common vernacular is a word meaning a guess or suggested explanation; this meaning is more akin to the scientific concept of “hypothesis.” When critics of evolution say evolution is “just a theory,” they are implying that there is little evidence supporting it and that it is still in the process of being rigorously tested. This is a mischaracterization.</p> <h3>Individuals Evolve</h3> <p>Evolution is the change in genetic composition of a population over time, specifically over generations, resulting from differential reproduction of individuals with certain alleles. Individuals do change over their lifetime, obviously, but this is called development and involves changes programmed by the set of genes the individual acquired at birth in coordination with the individual’s environment. When thinking about the evolution of a characteristic, it is probably best to think about the change of the average value of the characteristic in the population over time. For example, when natural selection leads to bill-size change in medium-ground finches in the Galápagos, this does not mean that individual bills on the finches are changing. If one measures the average bill size among all individuals in the population at one time and then measures the average bill size in the population several years later, this average value will be different as a result of evolution. Although some individuals may survive from the first time to the second, they will still have the same bill size; however, there will be many new individuals that contribute to the shift in average bill size.</p> <h3>Organisms Evolve on Purpose</h3> <p>Statements such as “organisms evolve in response to a change in an environment” are quite common, but such statements can lead to two types of misunderstandings. First, the statement must not be understood to mean that individual organisms evolve. The statement is shorthand for “a population evolves in response to a changing environment.” However, a second misunderstanding may arise by interpreting the statement to mean that the evolution is somehow intentional. A changed environment results in some individuals in the population, those with particular phenotypes, benefiting and therefore producing proportionately more offspring than other phenotypes. This results in change in the population if the characteristics are genetically determined.</p> <p>It is also important to understand that the variation that natural selection works on is already in a population and does not arise in response to an environmental change. For example, applying antibiotics to a population of bacteria will, over time, select a population of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. The resistance, which is caused by a gene, did not arise by mutation because of the application of the antibiotic. The gene for resistance was already present in the gene pool of the bacteria, likely at a low frequency. The antibiotic, which kills the bacterial cells without the resistance gene, strongly selects individuals that are resistant, since these would be the only ones that survived and divided. Experiments have demonstrated that mutations for antibiotic resistance do not arise as a result of antibiotic.</p> <p>In a larger sense, evolution is not goal directed. Species do not become “better” over time; they simply track their changing environment with adaptations that maximize their reproduction in a particular environment at a particular time. Evolution has no goal of making faster, bigger, more complex, or even smarter species, despite the commonness of this kind of language in popular discourse. What characteristics evolve in a species are a function of the variation present and the environment, both of which are constantly changing in a non-directional way. What trait is fit in one environment at one time may well be fatal at some point in the future. This holds equally well for a species of insect as it does the human species.</p> <h3>Evolution Explains the Origin of Life</h3> <p>It is a common misunderstanding that evolution includes an explanation of life’s origins. Conversely, some of the theory’s critics believe that it cannot explain the origin of life. The theory does not try to explain the origin of life. The theory of evolution explains how populations change over time and how life diversifies the origin of species. It does not shed light on the beginnings of life including the origins of the first cells, which is how life is defined. The mechanisms of the origin of life on Earth are a particularly difficult problem because it occurred a very long time ago, and presumably it just occurred once. Importantly, biologists believe that the presence of life on Earth precludes the possibility that the events that led to life on Earth can be repeated because the intermediate stages would immediately become food for existing living things.</p> <p>However, once a mechanism of inheritance was in place in the form of a molecule like DNA either within a cell or pre-cell, these entities would be subject to the principle of natural selection. More effective reproducers would increase in frequency at the expense of inefficient reproducers. So while evolution does not explain the origin of life, it may have something to say about some of the processes operating once pre-living entities acquired certain properties.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>In Summary:&nbsp;Evidence for Evolution</h3> <p>Since Darwin developed his ideas on descent with modification and the pressures of natural selection, a variety of evidence has been gathered supporting the theory of evolution. Fossil evidence shows the changes in lineages over millions of years, such as in hominids and horses. Studying anatomy allows scientists to identify homologous structures across diverse groups of related organisms, such as leg bones. Vestigial structures also offer clues to common ancestors. Using embryology, scientists can identify common ancestors through structures present only during development and not in the adult form.</p> <p>Biogeography offers further clues about evolutionary relationships. The presence of related organisms across continents indicates when these organisms may have evolved. For example, some flora and fauna of the northern continents are similar across these landmasses but distinct from that of the southern continents. Islands such as Australia and the Galapagos chain often have unique species that evolved after these landmasses separated from the mainland. Finally, molecular biology provides data supporting the theory of evolution. In particular, the universality of DNA and near universality of the genetic code for proteins shows that all life once shared a common ancestor. DNA also provides clues into how evolution may have happened. Gene duplications allow one copy to undergo mutational events without harming an organism, as one copy continues to produce functional protein.</p> <p>Many misconceptions exist about the theory of evolution—including some perpetuated by critics of the theory. First, evolution as a scientific theory&nbsp;means that it has years of observation and accumulated data supporting it. It is not “just a theory” as a person may say in common vernacular.</p> <p>Another misconception is that individuals evolve, though in fact it is populations that evolve over time. Individuals simply carry mutations. Furthermore, these mutations neither arise on purpose nor do they arise in response to an environmental pressure. Instead, mutations in DNA happen spontaneously and are already present in individuals of a population when a selective pressure occurs. Once the environment begins to favor a particular trait, then those individuals already carrying that mutation will have a selective advantage and are likely to survive better and outproduce others without the adaptation.</p> <p>Finally, the theory of evolution does not in fact address the origins of life on this planet. Scientists believe that we cannot, in fact, repeat the circumstances that led to life on Earth because at this time life already exists. The presence of life has so dramatically changed the environment that the origins cannot be totally produced for study.</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

That is, they relied on differences in the features of the organisms in a population and on the ability of these different features to be passed on to offspring.</p> <p>Darwin did not, however, know how traits were inherited. Like other scientists of his time, he thought that traits were passed on via blending inheritance. In this model, parents’ traits are supposed to permanently blend in their offspring. The blending model was disproven by Austrian monk Gregor Mendel, who found that traits are specified by non-blending heritable units called genes.</p> <p>Although Mendel published his work on genetics just a few years after Darwin published his ideas on evolution, Darwin probably never read Mendel’s work. Today, we can combine Darwin’s and Mendel’s ideas to arrive at a clearer understanding of what evolution is and how it takes place.</p> <h3>Microevolution and Population Genetics</h3> <p><strong>Microevolution</strong>, or evolution on a small scale, is defined as a change in the frequency of gene variants, alleles, in a population over generations. The field of biology that studies allele frequencies in populations and how they change over time is called <strong>population genetics</strong>.</p> <p>Microevolution is sometimes contrasted with <strong>macroevolution</strong>, evolution that involves large changes, such as formation of new groups or species, and happens over long time periods. However, most biologists view microevolution and macroevolution as the same process happening on different timescales. Microevolution adds up gradually, over long periods of time to produce macroevolutionary changes.</p> <p>Let’s look at three concepts that are core to the definition of microevolution: populations, alleles, and allele frequency.</p> <h4>Populations</h4> <p>A <strong>population</strong> is a group of organisms of the same species that are found in the same area and can interbreed. A population is the smallest unit that can evolve—in other words, an individual can’t evolve.</p> <h4>Alleles</h4> <p>An <strong>allele</strong> is a version of a <strong>gene</strong>, a heritable unit that controls a particular feature of an organism.</p> <p>For instance, Mendel studied a gene that controls flower color in pea plants. This gene comes in a white allele, <em>w</em>, and a purple allele, <em>W</em>. Each pea plant has two gene copies, which may be the same or different alleles. When the alleles are different, one—the <strong>dominant</strong> allele, <em>W</em>—may hide the other—the <strong>recessive allele</strong>, <em>w</em>. A plant’s set of alleles, called its <strong>genotype</strong>, determines its <strong>phenotype</strong>, or observable features, in this case flower color.</p> <div class="wp-nocaption aligncenter wp-image-4128 size-large"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4128 size-large" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/11183540/Alleles-1024x233.png" alt="The phenotype is the flower color.

A flower with two lowercase ws in its genotype will be white." width="1024" height="233" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/11183540/Alleles-1024x233.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/11183540/Alleles-300x68.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/11183540/Alleles-768x174.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/11183540/Alleles-65x15.png 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/11183540/Alleles-225x51.png 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1087/2017/01/11183540/Alleles-350x80.png 350w" /></div> <h4>Allele Frequency</h4> <p><strong>Allele frequency</strong> refers to how frequently a particular allele appears in a population. For instance, if all the alleles in a population of pea plants were purple alleles, <em>W</em>, the allele frequency of <em>W</em> would be 100%, or 1.0. However, if half the alleles were <em>W</em> and half were <em>w</em>, each allele would have an allele frequency of 50%, or 0.5.</p> <p>In general, we can define allele frequency as</p> <p style="text-align: center;">[latex]\text{Frequency of allele }A=\frac{\text{Number of copies of allele }A\text{ in population}}{\text{Total number of }A\text{/}a\text{ gene copies in population}}[/latex]</p> <p>Sometimes there are more than two alleles in a population (e.g., there might be <em>A</em>, <em>a</em>, and <em>A​<sub>i</sub></em> alleles of a gene). In that case, you would want to add up <em>all</em> of the different alleles to get your denominator.</p> <p>It’s also possible to calculate <strong>genotype frequencies</strong>—the fraction of individuals with a given genotype—and <strong>phenotype frequencies</strong>—the fraction of individuals with a given phenotype. Keep in mind, though, that these are different concepts from allele frequency. We’ll see an example of this difference next.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p>This video&nbsp;talks about population genetics, which helps to explain the evolution of populations over time.https://youtu.be/WhFKPaRnTdQ</p> </div> <h2>Selective and Environmental Pressures</h2> <p>Natural selection only acts on the population’s heritable traits: selecting for beneficial alleles and thus increasing their frequency in the population, while selecting against deleterious alleles and thereby decreasing their frequency—a process known as&nbsp;<strong>adaptive evolution</strong>. Natural selection does not act on individual alleles, however, but on entire organisms. An individual may carry a very beneficial genotype with a resulting phenotype that, for example, increases the ability to reproduce (fecundity), but if that same individual also carries an allele that results in a fatal childhood disease, that fecundity phenotype will not be passed on to the next generation because the individual will not live to reach reproductive age. Natural selection acts at the level of the individual; it selects for individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next generation, known as an organism’s <strong>evolutionary (Darwinian) fitness</strong>.</p> <p>Fitness is often quantifiable and is measured by scientists in the field. However, it is not the absolute fitness of an individual that counts, but rather how it compares to the other organisms in the population. This concept, called&nbsp;<strong>relative fitness</strong>, allows researchers to determine which individuals are contributing additional offspring to the next generation, and thus, how the population might evolve.</p> <p>There are several ways selection can affect population variation: stabilizing selection, directional selection, diversifying selection, frequency-dependent selection, and sexual selection. As natural selection influences the allele frequencies in a population, individuals can either become more or less genetically similar and the phenotypes displayed can become more similar or more disparate.</p> <h3>Stabilizing Selection</h3> <p>If natural selection favors an average phenotype, selecting against extreme variation, the population will undergo&nbsp;<strong>stabilizing selection </strong>(Figure 1a). In a population of mice that live in the woods, for example, natural selection is likely to favor individuals that best blend in with the forest floor and are less likely to be spotted by predators. Assuming the ground is a fairly consistent shade of brown, those mice whose fur is most closely matched to that color will be most likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes for their brown coat. Mice that carry alleles that make them a bit lighter or a bit darker will stand out against the ground and be more likely to fall victim to predation. As a result of this selection, the population’s genetic variance will decrease.</p> <h3>Directional Selection</h3> <p>When the environment changes, populations will often undergo&nbsp;<strong>directional selection</strong> (Figure 1b), which selects for phenotypes at one end of the spectrum of existing variation. A classic example of this type of selection is the evolution of the peppered moth in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the moths were predominately light in color, which allowed them to blend in with the light-colored trees and lichens in their environment. But as soot began spewing from factories, the trees became darkened, and the light-colored moths became easier for predatory birds to spot. Over time, the frequency of the melanic form of the moth increased because they had a higher survival rate in habitats affected by air pollution because their darker coloration blended with the sooty trees. Similarly, the hypothetical mouse population may evolve to take on a different coloration if something were to cause the forest floor where they live to change color. The result of this type of selection is a shift in the population’s genetic variance toward the new, fit phenotype.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">In science, sometimes things are believed to be true, and then new information comes to light that changes our understanding. The story of the peppered moth is an example: the facts behind the selection toward darker moths have recently been called into question. <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/31712/title/Peppered-Moths-Re-examined/" target="_blank">Read this&nbsp;article to learn more.</a></div> <h3>Diversifying Selection</h3> <p>Sometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages and be selected for by natural selection, while the intermediate phenotypes are, on average, less fit. Known as diversifying selection (Figure 1c), this is seen in many populations of animals that have multiple male forms. Large, dominant alpha males obtain mates by brute force, while small males can sneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an alpha male’s territory. In this case, both the alpha males and the “sneaking” males will be selected for, but medium-sized males, which can’t overtake the alpha males and are too big to sneak copulations, are selected against. Diversifying selection can also occur when environmental changes favor individuals on either end of the phenotypic spectrum. Imagine a population of mice living at the beach where there is light-colored sand interspersed with patches of tall grass. In this scenario, light-colored mice that blend in with the sand would be favored, as well as dark-colored mice that can hide in the grass. Medium-colored mice, on the other hand, would not blend in with either the grass or the sand, and would thus be more likely to be eaten by predators. The result of this type of selection is increased genetic variance as the population becomes more diverse.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <div id="attachment_1478" style="width: 735px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1478 size-full" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192350/Figure_19_03_011.png" alt="Part (a) shows a robin clutch size as an example of stabilizing selection. Robins typically lay four eggs. Larger clutches may result in malnourished chicks, while smaller clutches may result in no viable offspring. A wide bell curve indicates that, in the original population, there was a lot of variability in clutch size. Overlaying this wide bell curve is a narrow one that represents the clutch size after natural selection, which is much less variable. Part (b) shows moth color as an example of directional selection. Light-colored pepper moths are better camouflaged against a pristine environment, while dark-colored peppered moths are better camouflaged against a sooty environment. Thus, as the Industrial Revolution progressed in nineteenth-century England, the color of the moth population shifted from light to dark, an example of directional selection. A bell curve representing the original population and one representing the population after natural selection only slightly overlap. Part (c) shows rabbit coat color as an example of diversifying selection. In this hypothetical example, gray and Himalayan (gray and white) rabbits are better able to blend into their rocky environment than white ones. The original population is represented by a bell curve in which white is the most common coat color, while gray and Himalayan colors, on the right and left flank of the curve, are less common. After natural selection, the bell curve splits into two peaks, indicating gray and Himalayan coat color have become more common than the intermediate white coat color." width="725" height="895" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192350/Figure_19_03_011.png 725w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192350/Figure_19_03_011-243x300.png 243w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192350/Figure_19_03_011-65x80.png 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192350/Figure_19_03_011-225x278.png 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192350/Figure_19_03_011-350x432.png 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1.

A yellow-throated side-blotched lizard is smaller than either the blue-throated or orange-throated males and appears a bit like the females of the species, allowing it to sneak copulations. (credit: “tinyfroglet”/Flickr)</p> </div> <p>Another type of selection, called <strong>frequency-dependent selection</strong>, favors phenotypes that are either common (positive frequency-dependent selection) or rare (negative frequency-dependent selection). An interesting example of this type of selection is seen in a unique group of lizards of the Pacific Northwest. Male common side-blotched lizards come in three throat-color patterns: orange, blue, and yellow. Each of these forms has a different reproductive strategy: orange males are the strongest and can fight other males for access to their females; blue males are medium-sized and form strong pair bonds with their mates; and yellow males (Figure 2) are the smallest, and look a bit like females, which allows them to sneak copulations. Like a game of rock-paper-scissors, orange beats blue, blue beats yellow, and yellow beats orange in the competition for females. That is, the big, strong orange males can fight off the blue males to mate with the blue’s pair-bonded females, the blue males are successful at guarding their mates against yellow sneaker males, and the yellow males can sneak copulations from the potential mates of the large, polygynous orange males.</p> <p>In this scenario, orange males will be favored by natural selection when the population is dominated by blue males, blue males will thrive when the population is mostly yellow males, and yellow males will be selected for when orange males are the most populous. As a result, populations of side-blotched lizards cycle in the distribution of these phenotypes—in one generation, orange might be predominant, and then yellow males will begin to rise in frequency. Once yellow males make up a majority of the population, blue males will be selected for. Finally, when blue males become common, orange males will once again be favored.</p> <p>Negative frequency-dependent selection serves to increase the population’s genetic variance by selecting for rare phenotypes, whereas positive frequency-dependent selection usually decreases genetic variance by selecting for common phenotypes.</p> <h3>Sexual Selection</h3> <p>Males and females of certain species are often quite different from one another in ways beyond the reproductive organs. Males are often larger, for example, and display many elaborate colors and adornments, like the peacock’s tail, while females tend to be smaller and duller in decoration. Such differences are known as&nbsp;<strong>sexual dimorphisms</strong> (Figure 3), which arise from the fact that in many populations, particularly animal populations, there is more variance in the reproductive success of the males than there is of the females. That is, some males—often the bigger, stronger, or more decorated males—get the vast majority of the total matings, while others receive none. This can occur because the males are better at fighting off other males, or because females will choose to mate with the bigger or more decorated males. In either case, this variation in reproductive success generates a strong selection pressure among males to get those matings, resulting in the evolution of bigger body size and elaborate ornaments to get the females’ attention. Females, on the other hand, tend to get a handful of selected matings; therefore, they are more likely to select more desirable males.</p> <p>Sexual dimorphism varies widely among species, of course, and some species are even sex-role reversed. In such cases, females tend to have a greater variance in their reproductive success than males and are correspondingly selected for the bigger body size and elaborate traits usually characteristic of males.</p> <div id="attachment_1480" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1480" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192516/Figure_19_03_03abc-1024x336.jpg" alt="The photo on the left shows a peacock with a bright blue body and flared tail feathers standing next to a brown, drab peahen.

Sexual dimorphism is observed in (a) peacocks and peahens, (b) Argiope appensa spiders (the female spider is the large one), and in (c) wood ducks. (credit “spiders”: modification of work by “Sanba38″/Wikimedia Commons; credit “duck”: modification of work by Kevin Cole)</p> </div> <p>The selection pressures on males and females to obtain matings is known as sexual selection; it can result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics that do not benefit the individual’s likelihood of survival but help to maximize its reproductive success. Sexual selection can be so strong that it selects for traits that are actually detrimental to the individual’s survival. Think, once again, about the peacock’s tail. While it is beautiful and the male with the largest, most colorful tail is more likely to win the female, it is not the most practical appendage. In addition to being more visible to predators, it makes the males slower in their attempted escapes. There is some evidence that this risk, in fact, is why females like the big tails in the first place. The speculation is that large tails carry risk, and only the best males survive that risk: the bigger the tail, the more fit the male. This idea is known as the&nbsp;<strong>handicap principle</strong>.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<strong>good genes hypothesis</strong> states that males develop these impressive ornaments to show off their efficient metabolism or their ability to fight disease. Females then choose males with the most impressive traits because it signals their genetic superiority, which they will then pass on to their offspring. Though it might be argued that females should not be picky because it will likely reduce their number of offspring, if better males father more fit offspring, it may be beneficial. Fewer, healthier offspring may increase the chances of survival more than many, weaker offspring.</p> <p>In both the handicap principle and the good genes hypothesis, the trait is said to be an&nbsp;<strong>honest signal</strong> of the males’ quality, thus giving females a way to find the fittest mates— males that will pass the best genes to their offspring.</p> <h3>No Perfect Organism</h3> <p>Natural selection is a driving force in evolution and can generate populations that are better adapted to survive and successfully reproduce in their environments. But natural selection cannot produce the perfect organism. Natural selection can only select on existing variation in the population; it does not create anything from scratch. Thus, it is limited by a population’s existing genetic variance and whatever new alleles arise through mutation and gene flow.</p> <p>Natural selection is also limited because it works at the level of individuals, not alleles, and some alleles are linked due to their physical proximity in the genome, making them more likely to be passed on together (linkage disequilibrium). Any given individual may carry some beneficial alleles and some unfavorable alleles. It is the net effect of these alleles, or the organism’s fitness, upon which natural selection can act. As a result, good alleles can be lost if they are carried by individuals that also have several overwhelmingly bad alleles; likewise, bad alleles can be kept if they are carried by individuals that have enough good alleles to result in an overall fitness benefit.</p> <p>Furthermore, natural selection can be constrained by the relationships between different polymorphisms. One morph may confer a higher fitness than another, but may not increase in frequency due to the fact that going from the less beneficial to the more beneficial trait would require going through a less beneficial phenotype. Think back to the mice that live at the beach. Some are light-colored and blend in with the sand, while others are dark and blend in with the patches of grass. The dark-colored mice may be, overall, more fit than the light-colored mice, and at first glance, one might expect the light-colored mice be selected for a darker coloration. But remember that the intermediate phenotype, a medium-colored coat, is very bad for the mice—they cannot blend in with either the sand or the grass and are more likely to be eaten by predators. As a result, the light-colored mice would not be selected for a dark coloration because those individuals that began moving in that direction (began being selected for a darker coat) would be less fit than those that stayed light.</p> <p>Finally, it is important to understand that not all evolution is adaptive. While natural selection selects the fittest individuals and often results in a more fit population overall, other forces of evolution, including genetic drift and gene flow, often do the opposite: introducing deleterious alleles to the population’s gene pool. Evolution has no purpose—it is not changing a population into a preconceived ideal. It is simply the sum of the various forces described in this chapter and how they influence the genetic and phenotypic variance of a population.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>In Summary: Selective and Environmental Pressures</h3> <p>Because natural selection acts to increase the frequency of beneficial alleles and traits while decreasing the frequency of deleterious qualities, it is adaptive evolution. Natural selection acts at the level of the individual, selecting for those that have a higher overall fitness compared to the rest of the population. If the fit phenotypes are those that are similar, natural selection will result in stabilizing selection, and an overall decrease in the population’s variation. Directional selection works to shift a population’s variance toward a new, fit phenotype, as environmental conditions change. In contrast, diversifying selection results in increased genetic variance by selecting for two or more distinct phenotypes.</p> <p>Other types of selection include frequency-dependent selection, in which individuals with either common (positive frequency-dependent selection) or rare (negative frequency-dependent selection) phenotypes are selected for. Finally, sexual selection results from the fact that one sex has more variance in the reproductive success than the other. As a result, males and females experience different selective pressures, which can often lead to the evolution of phenotypic differences, or sexual dimorphisms, between the two.</p> </div> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

Only a few of the more than one million known species of insects are represented in this beetle collection. Beetles are a major subgroup of insects. They make up about 40 percent of all insect species and about 25 percent of all known species of organisms.</p> </div> <p>Why do biologists classify organisms? The major reason is to make sense of the incredible diversity of life on Earth. Scientists have identified millions of different species of organisms. Among animals, the most diverse group of organisms is the insects. More than one million different species of insects have already been described. An estimated nine million insect species have yet to be identified. A tiny fraction of insect species is shown in the beetle collection in Figure 1.</p> <p>As diverse as insects are, there may be even more species of bacteria, another major group of organisms. Clearly, there is a need to organize the tremendous diversity of life. Classification allows scientists to organize and better understand the basic similarities and differences among organisms. This knowledge is necessary to understand the present diversity and the past evolutionary history of life on Earth.</p> <h3>Phylogenetic Trees</h3> <p>Scientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms. A <strong>phylogenetic tree</strong> is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms. Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one cannot go back to confirm the proposed relationships. In other words, a “tree of life” can be constructed to illustrate when different organisms evolved and to show the relationships among different organisms (Figure 2).</p> <p>Each group of organisms went through its own evolutionary journey, called its phylogeny. Each organism shares relatedness with others, and based on morphologic and genetic evidence, scientists attempt to map the evolutionary pathways of all life on Earth. Many scientists build phylogenetic trees to illustrate evolutionary relationships.</p> <h2>Structure of Phylogenetic Trees</h2> <p>A&nbsp;phylogenetic tree can be read like a map of evolutionary history. Many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor. Scientists call such trees rooted, which means there is a single ancestral lineage (typically drawn from the bottom or left) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate. Notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains—Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya—diverge from a single point and branch off. The small branch that plants and animals (including humans) occupy in this diagram shows how recent and miniscule these groups are compared with other organisms. Unrooted trees don’t show a common ancestor but do show relationships among species.</p> <div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1482" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02192630/Figure_20_01_01-1024x308.jpg" alt="The phylogenetic tree in part a is rooted and resembles a living tree, with a common ancestor indicated as the base of the trunk.

The point where a split occurs, called a&nbsp;<strong>branch point</strong>, represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one. A lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called <strong>basal taxon</strong>. When two lineages stem from the same branch point, they are called <strong>sister taxa</strong>. A branch with more than two lineages is called a <strong>polytomy</strong> and serves to illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships. It is important to note that although sister taxa and polytomy do share an ancestor, it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from each other. Organisms in two taxa may have split apart at a specific branch point, but neither taxa gave rise to the other.</p> <div id="attachment_1484" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1484" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02193247/Figure_20_01_02.jpg" alt="Illustration shows a phylogenetic tree that starts at a root, indicating that all organisms on the tree share a common ancestor.

The root of a phylogenetic tree indicates that an ancestral lineage gave rise to all organisms on the tree. A branch point indicates where two lineages diverged.

A branch with more than two lineages is a polytomy.</p> </div> <p>The diagrams above can serve as a pathway to understanding evolutionary history. The pathway can be traced from the origin of life to any individual species by navigating through the evolutionary branches between the two points. Also, by starting with a single species and tracing back towards the “trunk” of the tree, one can discover that species’ ancestors, as well as where lineages share a common ancestry. In addition, the tree can be used to study entire groups of organisms.</p> <p>Another point to mention on phylogenetic tree structure is that rotation at branch points does not change the information. For example, if a branch point was rotated and the taxon order changed, this would not alter the information because the evolution of each taxon from the branch point was independent of the other.</p> <p>Many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time; these disciplines together contribute to building, updating, and maintaining the “tree of life.” Information is used to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships in a scientific field called systematics. Data may be collected from fossils, from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism, and by DNA analysis. By combining data from many sources, scientists can put together the phylogeny of an organism; since phylogenetic trees are hypotheses, they will continue to change as new types of life are discovered and new information is learned.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>Video Review</h3> <p><script type="text/javascript" src="//static.3playmedia.com/p/projects/20361/files/1280816/plugins/11085.js"></script><script src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api" type="text/javascript"></script><br /> </p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

If two closely related lineages evolved under significantly varied surroundings or after the evolution of a major new adaptation, it is possible for the two groups to appear more different than other groups that are not as closely related. For example, the phylogenetic tree in Figure 4&nbsp;shows that lizards and rabbits both have amniotic eggs, whereas frogs do not; yet lizards and frogs appear more similar than lizards and rabbits.</p> <div id="attachment_1485" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1485" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02193329/Figure_20_01_03.jpg" alt="The ladder-like phylogenetic tree starts with a trunk at the left.

This ladder-like phylogenetic tree of vertebrates is rooted by an organism that lacked a vertebral column. At each branch point, organisms with different characters are placed in different groups based on the characteristics they share.</p> </div> <p>Another aspect of phylogenetic trees is that, unless otherwise indicated, the branches do not account for length of time, only the evolutionary order. In other words, the length of a branch does not typically mean more time passed, nor does a short branch mean less time passed— unless specified on the diagram. For example, in Figure 4, the tree does not indicate how much time passed between the evolution of amniotic eggs and hair. What the tree does show is the order in which things took place. Again using Figure 4, the tree shows that the oldest trait is the vertebral column, followed by hinged jaws, and so forth. Remember that any phylogenetic tree is a part of the greater whole, and like a real tree, it does not grow in only one direction after a new branch develops.</p> <p>So, for the organisms in Figure 4, just because a vertebral column evolved does not mean that invertebrate evolution ceased, it only means that a new branch formed. Also, groups that are not closely related, but evolve under similar conditions, may appear more phenotypically similar to each other than to a close relative.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><a href="http://itol.embl.de/" target="_blank">Head to this&nbsp;website to see interactive exercises that allow you to explore the evolutionary relationships among species.</a></div> <h2>The Taxonomic Classification System</h2> <p><strong>Taxonomy</strong> (which literally means “arrangement law”) is the science of classifying organisms to construct internationally shared classification systems with each organism placed into more and more inclusive groupings. Think about how a grocery store is organized. One large space is divided into departments, such as produce, dairy, and meats. Then each department further divides into aisles, then each aisle into categories and brands, and then finally a single product. This organization from larger to smaller, more specific categories is called a hierarchical system.</p> <p>The taxonomic classification system (also called the Linnaean system after its inventor, Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician) uses a hierarchical model. Moving from the point of origin, the groups become more specific, until one branch ends as a single species. For example, after the common beginning of all life, scientists divide organisms into three large categories called a domain: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Within each domain is a second category called a&nbsp;<strong>kingdom</strong>. After kingdoms, the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are: <strong>phylum</strong>, <strong>class</strong>, <strong>order</strong>, <strong>family</strong>, <strong>genus</strong>, and <strong>species</strong> (Figure 5).</p> <div id="attachment_1486" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1486" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02193407/Figure_20_01_04ab.jpg" alt="The illustration shows the classification of a dog, which belongs in the domain Eukarya, kingdom Animalia, phylum Chordata, class Mammalia, order Carnivore, family Canidae, genus Canis, species Canis lupus, and the subspecies is Canis lupus familiaris." width="544" height="994" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02193407/Figure_20_01_04ab.jpg 544w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02193407/Figure_20_01_04ab-164x300.jpg 164w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02193407/Figure_20_01_04ab-65x119.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02193407/Figure_20_01_04ab-225x411.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02193407/Figure_20_01_04ab-350x640.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 5.

The common dog, <i>Canis lupus familiaris</i>, is a subspecies of <i>Canis lupus</i>, which also includes the wolf and dingo. (credit “dog”: modification of work by Janneke Vreugdenhil)</p> </div> <p>The kingdom Animalia stems from the Eukarya domain. For the common dog, the classification levels would be as shown in Figure 5. Therefore, the full name of an organism technically has eight terms. For the dog, it is: Eukarya, Animalia, Chordata, Mammalia, Carnivora, Canidae,&nbsp;<em>Canis, </em>and <em>lupus</em>. Notice that each name is capitalized except for species, and the genus and species names are italicized. Scientists generally refer to an organism only by its genus and species, which is its two-word scientific name, in what is called <strong>binomial nomenclature</strong>. Therefore, the scientific name of the dog is <em>Canis lupus</em>. The name at each level is also called a <strong>taxon</strong>. In other words, dogs are in order Carnivora. Carnivora is the name of the taxon at the order level; Canidae is the taxon at the family level, and so forth. Organisms also have a common name that people typically use, in this case, dog. Note that the dog is additionally a subspecies: the “<em>familiaris</em>” in <em>Canis lupus familiaris. </em>Subspecies are members of the same species that are capable of mating and reproducing viable offspring, but they are considered separate subspecies due to geographic or behavioral isolation or other factors.</p> <p>Figure 6&nbsp;shows how the levels move toward specificity with other organisms. Notice how the dog shares a domain with the widest diversity of organisms, including plants and butterflies. At each sublevel, the organisms become more similar because they are more closely related. Historically, scientists classified organisms using characteristics, but as DNA technology developed, more precise phylogenies have been determined.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <div id="attachment_1487" style="width: 1025px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1487" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02193622/Figure_20_01_05-1015x1024.png" alt="Illustration shows the taxonomic groups shared by various species.

The phosphate groups on these molecules each have a net negative charge. An entire set of DNA molecules in the nucleus is called the genome. DNA has two complementary strands linked by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases. The two strands can be separated by exposure to high temperatures (DNA denaturation) and can be reannealed by cooling. The DNA can be replicated by the DNA polymerase enzyme. Unlike DNA, which is located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, RNA molecules leave the nucleus. The most common type of RNA that is analyzed is the messenger RNA (mRNA) because it represents the protein-coding genes that are actively expressed. However, RNA molecules present some other challenges to analysis, as they are often less stable than DNA.</p> <h3>DNA and RNA Extraction</h3> <p>To study or manipulate nucleic acids, the DNA or RNA must first be isolated or extracted from the cells. Various techniques are used to extract different types of DNA (Figure 2). Most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that are not desired (such as degradation of unwanted molecules and separation from the DNA sample). Cells are broken using a&nbsp;<strong>lysis buffer</strong> (a solution which is mostly a detergent); lysis means “to split.” These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes. Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as <strong>proteases</strong> that break down proteins, and <strong>ribonucleases</strong> (RNAses) that break down RNA. The DNA is then precipitated using alcohol. Human genomic DNA is usually visible as a gelatinous, white mass. The DNA samples can be stored frozen at –80°C for several years.</p> <div id="attachment_1491" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1491" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02195440/Figure_17_01_02.jpg" alt="This illustration shows the four main steps of DNA extraction.

The nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or fragments. The nucleic acids are loaded into a slot near the negative electrode of a semisolid, porous gel matrix and pushed&nbsp;toward the positive electrode at the opposite end of the gel. Smaller molecules move through the pores in the gel faster than larger molecules; this difference in the rate of migration separates the fragments on the basis of size. There are molecular weight standard samples that can be run alongside the molecules to provide a size comparison. Nucleic acids in a gel matrix can be observed using various fluorescent or colored dyes. Distinct nucleic acid fragments appear as bands at specific distances from the top of the gel (the negative electrode end) on the basis of their size (Figure 3). A mixture of genomic DNA fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear, whereas uncut genomic DNA is usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single large band at the top of the gel.</p> <h4>Amplification of Nucleic Acid Fragments by Polymerase Chain Reaction</h4> <p>Although genomic DNA is visible to the naked eye when it is extracted in bulk, DNA analysis often requires focusing on one or more specific regions of the genome.&nbsp;<strong>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)</strong> is a technique used to amplify specific regions of DNA for further analysis (Figure 4). PCR is used for many purposes in laboratories, such as the cloning of gene fragments to analyze genetic diseases, identification of contaminant foreign DNA in a sample, and the amplification of DNA for sequencing. More practical applications include the determination of paternity and detection of genetic diseases.</p> <div id="attachment_1492" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1492" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02195841/Figure_17_01_04-1024x978.jpg" alt="Illustration shows the amplification of a DNA sequence by the polymerase chain reaction. PCR consists of three steps—denaturation, annealing, and DNA synthesis—that occur at high, low, and intermediate temperatures. In step 1, the denaturation step, the sample is heated to a high temperature so the DNA strands separate. In step 2, annealing, the sample is cooled so two primers can anneal to the two strands of DNA. The primers are spaced such that the sequence of interest between them will be amplified. In step 3, DNA synthesis, the sample is warmed to the optimal temperature for Taq polymerase, which synthesizes the complementary strand from the primer to the 3' end of the molecule. This cycle is repeated again and again. Each time, the newly synthesized strands serve as templates so that the amount of DNA doubles with each cycle. As the cycles continue, more and more strands are the size of the distance between the two primers; in the end, the vast majority of strands are this size." width="1024" height="978" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02195841/Figure_17_01_04-1024x978.jpg 1024w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02195841/Figure_17_01_04-300x287.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02195841/Figure_17_01_04-768x734.jpg 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02195841/Figure_17_01_04-65x62.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02195841/Figure_17_01_04-225x215.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02195841/Figure_17_01_04-350x334.jpg 350w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02195841/Figure_17_01_04.jpg 1117w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4.

Southern blots are used to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences in a given genome, and northern blots are used to detect gene expression.&nbsp;Note that “Southern” blotting is capitalized but no other type of blotting; Southern blotting is named after the scientist who pioneered this technique, Edwin Southern.

The sequencing method is based on the use of chain terminators, the dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). The dideoxynucleotides, or ddNTPSs, differ from the deoxynucleotides by the lack of a free 3′ OH group on the five-carbon sugar. If a ddNTP is added to a growing a DNA strand, the chain is not extended any further because the free 3′ OH group needed to add another nucleotide is not available. By using a predetermined ratio of deoxyribonucleotides to dideoxynucleotides, it is possible to generate DNA fragments of different sizes.</p> <p>The DNA sample to be sequenced is denatured or separated into two strands by heating it to high temperatures. The DNA is divided into four tubes in which a primer, DNA polymerase, and all four nucleotides (A, T, G, and C) are added. In addition to each of the four tubes, limited quantities of one of the four dideoxynucleotides are added to each tube respectively. The tubes are labeled as A, T, G, and C according to the ddNTP added. For detection purposes, each of the four dideoxynucleotides carries a different fluorescent label. Chain elongation continues until a fluorescent dideoxy nucleotide is incorporated, after which no further elongation takes place. After the reaction is over, electrophoresis is performed. Even a difference in length of a single base can be detected. The sequence is read from a laser scanner. For his work on DNA sequencing, Sanger received a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1980.</p> <p>As already mentioned, gel <strong>electrophoresis</strong> (Figure 3) is a technique used to separate DNA fragments of different sizes. Usually the gel is made of a chemical called agarose. Agarose powder is added to a buffer and heated. After cooling, the gel solution is poured into a casting tray. Once the gel has solidified, the DNA is loaded on the gel and electric current is applied. The DNA has a net negative charge and moves from the negative electrode toward the positive electrode. The electric current is applied for sufficient time to let the DNA separate according to size; the smallest fragments will be farthest from the well (where the DNA was loaded), and the heavier molecular weight fragments will be closest to the well. Once the DNA is separated, the gel is stained with a DNA-specific dye for viewing it.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">Sanger’s genome sequencing has led to a race to sequence human genomes at a rapid speed and low cost, often referred to as the $1000 in one day sequence. <a href="http://www.yourgenome.org/video/sequencing-at-speed" target="_blank">Learn more by watching the&nbsp;Sequencing at Speed animation&nbsp;here.</a></div> <div class="key-takeaways textbox"><h3>Neanderthal Genome: How Are We Related?</h3> <p>The first draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome was published by Richard E. Green et al. in 2010.<span class="footnote">Richard E. Green et al., “A Draft Sequence of the Neandertal Genome,” <em>Science</em> 328 (2010): 710–22.</span>&nbsp;Neanderthals are the closest ancestors of present-day humans. They were known to have lived in Europe and Western Asia before they disappeared from fossil records approximately 30,000 years ago. Green’s team studied almost 40,000-year-old fossil remains that were selected from sites across the world. Extremely sophisticated means of sample preparation and DNA sequencing were employed because of the fragile nature of the bones and heavy microbial contamination. In their study, the scientists were able to sequence some four billion base pairs. The Neanderthal sequence was compared with that of present-day humans from across the world. After comparing the sequences, the researchers found that the Neanderthal genome had 2 to 3 percent greater similarity to people living outside Africa than to people in Africa. While current theories have suggested that all present-day humans can be traced to a small ancestral population in Africa, the data from the Neanderthal genome may contradict this view. Green and his colleagues also discovered DNA segments among people in Europe and Asia that are more similar to Neanderthal sequences than to other contemporary human sequences. Another interesting observation was that Neanderthals are as closely related to people from Papua New Guinea as to those from China or France. This is surprising because Neanderthal fossil remains have been located only in Europe and West Asia. Most likely, genetic exchange took place between Neanderthals and modern humans as modern humans emerged out of Africa, before the divergence of Europeans, East Asians, and Papua New Guineans.</p> <p>Several genes seem to have undergone changes from Neanderthals during the evolution of present-day humans. These genes are involved in cranial structure, metabolism, skin morphology, and cognitive development. One of the genes that is of particular interest is&nbsp;<em>RUNX2</em>, which is different in modern day humans and Neanderthals. This gene is responsible for the prominent frontal bone, bell-shaped rib cage, and dental differences seen in Neanderthals. It is speculated that an evolutionary change in <em>RUNX2</em> was important in the origin of modern-day humans, and this affected the cranium and the upper body.</p> </div> <div class="textbox shaded"><p>Watch&nbsp;Svante Pääbo’s talk explaining the Neanderthal genome research at the 2011 annual TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) conference.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kU0ei9ApmsY/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &quot;Svante Pääbo: DNA clues to our inner neanderthal&quot;" title="Svante Pääbo: DNA clues to our inner neanderthal" /> <p>A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

A plasmid (also called a vector) is a small circular DNA molecule that replicates independently of the chromosomal DNA of microorganisms such as <em>E. coli</em>. In cloning, the plasmid molecules can be used to provide a “folder” in which to insert a desired DNA fragment. Plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host for proliferation. In the bacterial context, the fragment of DNA from the human genome (or the genome of another organism that is being studied) is referred to as&nbsp;<strong>foreign DNA</strong>, or a transgene, to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium, which is called the <strong>host DNA</strong>.</p> <p>Plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations (such as&nbsp;<em>Escherichia coli</em>) and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism, such as <strong>antibiotic resistance</strong> (the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics). Plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large-scale production of important reagents, such as insulin and human growth hormone. An important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment can be introduced via the <strong>multiple cloning site (MCS)</strong>. The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases. <strong>Restriction endonucleases</strong> recognize specific DNA sequences and cut them in a predictable manner; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA. Many restriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two strands of DNA, such that the cut ends have a 2- or 4-base single-stranded overhang. Because these overhangs are capable of annealing with complementary overhangs, these are called “sticky ends.” Addition of an enzyme called DNA ligase permanently joins the DNA fragments via phosphodiester bonds. In this way, any DNA fragment generated by restriction endonuclease cleavage can be spliced between the two ends of a plasmid DNA that has been cut with the same restriction endonuclease (Figure&nbsp;1).</p> <h3>Recombinant DNA Molecules</h3> <p>Plasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called&nbsp;<strong>recombinant DNA</strong> molecules because they are created artificially and do not occur in nature. They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis. Proteins that are expressed from recombinant DNA molecules are called <strong>recombinant proteins</strong>. Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes. The recombinant DNA may need to be moved into a different vector (or host) that is better designed for gene expression. Plasmids may also be engineered to express proteins only when stimulated by certain environmental factors, so that scientists can control the expression of the recombinant proteins.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">View an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dnalc.org/resources/3d/20-mechanism-of-recombination.html" target="_blank">animation of recombination in cloning</a> from the DNA Learning Center.</div> <h2>Cellular Cloning</h2> <p>Unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, naturally produce clones of themselves when they replicate asexually by binary fission; this is known as&nbsp;<strong>cellular cloning</strong>.

The vector has a lacZ gene, which is necessary for metabolizing lactose, and a gene for ampicillin resistance. Within the lacZ gene are restriction sites, sequences of DNA cut by a particular restriction enzyme. The DNA to be cloned and the plasmid are both cut by the same restriction enzyme. The restriction enzyme staggers the cuts on the two strands of DNA, such that each strand has an overhanging single-stranded bit of DNA. On one strand, the sequence of the overhang is GATC, and on the other, the sequence is CTAG. These two sequences are complementary, and allow the fragment of foreign DNA to anneal with the plasmid. An enzyme called ligase joins the two pieces together. The ligated plasmid is then transformed into a bacterial strain that lacks the lacZ gene and is sensitive to the antibiotic ampicillin. The bacteria are plated on media containing ampicillin, so that only bacteria that have taking up the plasmid (which has an ampicillin resistance gene) will grow. The media also contains X-gal, a chemical that is metabolized in the same way as lactose. Plasmids lacking the insert are able to metabolize X-gal, releasing a dye from X-gal that turns the colony blue. Plasmids with the insert have a disrupted lacZ gene and produce white colonies. Thus, colonies containing the cloned DNA can be selected on the basis of color." width="1024" height="940" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02200428/Figure_17_01_06-1024x940.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02200428/Figure_17_01_06-300x275.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02200428/Figure_17_01_06-768x705.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02200428/Figure_17_01_06-65x60.png 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02200428/Figure_17_01_06-225x206.png 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02200428/Figure_17_01_06-350x321.png 350w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02200428/Figure_17_01_06.png 1043w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1.

The experiment would result in blue colonies only.</div> </div> </div> <h2>Reproductive Cloning</h2> <p><strong>Reproductive cloning</strong> is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism. Most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals (parents), making it impossible for generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent. Recent advances in biotechnology have made it possible to artificially induce asexual reproduction of mammals in the laboratory.</p> <p>Parthenogenesis, or “virgin birth,” occurs when an embryo grows and develops without the fertilization of the egg occurring; this is a form of asexual reproduction. An example of parthenogenesis occurs in species in which the female lays an egg and if the egg is fertilized, it is a diploid egg and the individual develops into a female; if the egg is not fertilized, it remains a haploid egg and develops into a male. The unfertilized egg is called a parthenogenic, or virgin, egg. Some insects and reptiles lay parthenogenic eggs that can develop into adults.</p> <p>Sexual reproduction requires two cells; when the haploid egg and sperm cells fuse, a diploid zygote results. The zygote nucleus contains the genetic information to produce a new individual. However, early embryonic development requires the cytoplasmic material contained in the egg cell. This idea forms the basis for reproductive cloning. Therefore, if the haploid nucleus of an egg cell is replaced with a diploid nucleus from the cell of any individual of the same species (called a donor), it will become a zygote that is genetically identical to the donor. Somatic cell nuclear transfer is the technique of transferring a diploid nucleus into an enucleated egg. It can be used for either therapeutic cloning or reproductive cloning.</p> <p>The first cloned animal was Dolly, a sheep who was born in 1996. The success rate of reproductive cloning at the time was very low. Dolly lived for seven years and died of respiratory complications (Figure&nbsp;2). There is speculation that because the cell DNA belongs to an older individual, the age of the DNA may affect the life expectancy of a cloned individual. Since Dolly, several animals such as horses, bulls, and goats have been successfully cloned, although these individuals often exhibit facial, limb, and cardiac abnormalities. There have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of embryonic stem cells, sometimes referred to as cloning for therapeutic purposes. Therapeutic cloning produces stem cells to attempt to remedy detrimental diseases or defects (unlike reproductive cloning, which aims to reproduce an organism). Still, therapeutic cloning efforts have met with resistance because of bioethical considerations.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Practice Question</h3> <div id="attachment_1495" style="width: 481px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1495" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02200606/Figure_17_01_07.png" alt="To clone Dolly the sheep, a Scottish Blackface sheep was used as a cytoplasmic donor.

The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering. The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is called a <strong>genetically modified organism (GMO)</strong>. If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a different species, the host organism is called <strong>transgenic</strong>. Bacteria, plants, and animals have been genetically modified since the early 1970s for academic, medical, agricultural, and industrial purposes. In the US, GMOs such as Roundup-ready soybeans and borer-resistant corn are part of many common processed foods.</p> <h3>Gene Targeting</h3> <p>Although classical methods of studying the function of genes began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic basis of that phenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and ask: “What does this gene or DNA element do?” This technique, called reverse genetics, has resulted in reversing the classic genetic methodology. This method would be similar to damaging a body part to determine its function. An insect that loses a wing cannot fly, which means that the function of the wing is flight. The classical genetic method would compare insects that cannot fly with insects that can fly, and observe that the non-flying insects have lost wings. Similarly, mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene function. The methods used to disable gene function are collectively called gene targeting.&nbsp;<strong>Gene targeting</strong> is the use of recombinant DNA vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene, either by introducing mutations in a gene, or by eliminating the expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the genome of an organism.</p> <h2><strong>Check Your Understanding</strong></h2> <p>Answer the question(s) below to see how well you understand the topics covered in the previous section.

Gene therapy using an adenovirus vector can be used to cure certain genetic diseases in which a person has a defective gene. (credit: NIH)</p> </div> <p>The process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment is called&nbsp;<strong>genetic diagnosis</strong> by <strong>genetic testing</strong>. Depending on the inheritance patterns of a disease-causing gene, family members are advised to undergo genetic testing. For example, women diagnosed with breast cancer are usually advised to have a biopsy so that the medical team can determine the genetic basis of cancer development. Treatment plans are based on the findings of genetic tests that determine the type of cancer. If the cancer is caused by inherited gene mutations, other female relatives are also advised to undergo genetic testing and periodic screening for breast cancer. Genetic testing is also offered for fetuses (or embryos with <em>in vitro</em> fertilization) to determine the presence or absence of disease-causing genes in families with specific debilitating diseases.</p> <p><strong>Gene therapy</strong> is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease. In its simplest form, it involves the introduction of a good gene at a random location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a mutated gene. The good gene is usually introduced into diseased cells as part of a vector transmitted by a virus that can infect the host cell and deliver the foreign DNA (Figure 1). More advanced forms of gene therapy try to correct the mutation at the original site in the genome, such as is the case with treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).</p> <div class="textbox shaded">Here’s a website to help you learn&nbsp;more <a href="https://www.scid.net/" target="_blank">information on SCID</a> and its gene therapy trials.</div> <h3>Production of Vaccines, Antibiotics, and Hormones</h3> <p>Traditional vaccination strategies use weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms to mount the initial immune response. Modern techniques use the genes of microorganisms cloned into vectors to mass produce the desired antigen. The antigen is then introduced into the body to stimulate the primary immune response and trigger immune memory. Genes cloned from the influenza virus have been used to combat the constantly changing strains of this virus.</p> <p>Antibiotics are a biotechnological product. They are naturally produced by microorganisms, such as fungi, to attain an advantage over bacterial populations. Antibiotics are produced on a large scale by cultivating and manipulating fungal cells.</p> <p>Recombinant DNA technology was used to produce large-scale quantities of human insulin in&nbsp;<em>E. coli</em> as early as 1978. Previously, it was only possible to treat diabetes with pig insulin, which caused allergic reactions in humans because of differences in the gene product. In addition, human growth hormone (HGH) is used to treat growth disorders in children. The HGH gene was cloned from a cDNA library and inserted into <em>E. coli</em> cells by cloning it into a bacterial vector.</p> <h2>Agricultural Biotechnology</h2> <p>Biotechnology in agriculture can enhance resistance to disease, pest, and environmental stress, and improve both crop yield and quality.</p> <h3>Transgenic Animals</h3> <p>Although several recombinant proteins used in medicine are successfully produced in bacteria, some proteins require a eukaryotic animal host for proper processing. For this reason, the desired genes are cloned and expressed in animals, such as sheep, goats, chickens, and mice. Animals that have been modified to express recombinant DNA are called transgenic animals. Several human proteins are expressed in the milk of transgenic sheep and goats, and some are expressed in the eggs of chickens. Mice have been used extensively for expressing and studying the effects of recombinant genes and mutations.</p> <h3>Transgenic Plants</h3> <div id="attachment_1499" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1499" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02200828/Figure_17_01_09.jpg" alt="Photo shows corn cobs with different colors, including yellow, white, red, and a mixture of these colors." width="250" height="376" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02200828/Figure_17_01_09.jpg 450w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02200828/Figure_17_01_09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02200828/Figure_17_01_09-65x98.jpg 65w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02200828/Figure_17_01_09-225x338.jpg 225w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02200828/Figure_17_01_09-350x526.jpg 350w" /> <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1. Corn, a major agricultural crop used to create products for a variety of industries, is often modified through plant biotechnology. (credit: Keith Weller, USDA)</p> </div> <p>Manipulating the DNA of plants (i.e., creating GMOs) has helped to create desirable traits, such as disease resistance, herbicide and pesticide resistance, better nutritional value, and better shelf-life (Figure 1). Plants are the most important source of food for the human population. Farmers developed ways to select for plant varieties with desirable traits long before modern-day biotechnology practices were established.</p> <p>Plants that have received recombinant DNA from other species are called transgenic plants. Because they are not natural, transgenic plants and other GMOs are closely monitored by government agencies to ensure that they are fit for human consumption and do not endanger other plant and animal life. Because foreign genes can spread to other species in the environment, extensive testing is required to ensure ecological stability. Staples like corn, potatoes, and tomatoes were the first crop plants to be genetically engineered.</p> <h4>Transformation of Plants Using <em>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</em></h4> <p>Gene transfer occurs naturally between species in microbial populations. Many viruses that cause human diseases, such as cancer, act by incorporating their DNA into the human genome. In plants, tumors caused by the bacterium&nbsp;<em>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</em> occur by transfer of DNA from the bacterium to the plant. Although the tumors do not kill the plants, they make the plants stunted and more susceptible to harsh environmental conditions. Many plants, such as walnuts, grapes, nut trees, and beets, are affected by <em>A. tumefaciens</em>. The artificial introduction of DNA into plant cells is more challenging than in animal cells because of the thick plant cell wall.</p> <p>Researchers used the natural transfer of DNA from&nbsp;<em>Agrobacterium</em> to a plant host to introduce DNA fragments of their choice into plant hosts. In nature, the disease-causing <em>A. tumefaciens</em> have a set of plasmids, called the Ti plasmids (tumor-inducing plasmids), that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants. DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into the infected plant cell’s genome. Researchers manipulate the Ti plasmids to remove the tumor-causing genes and insert the desired DNA fragment for transfer into the plant genome. The Ti plasmids carry antibiotic resistance genes to aid selection and can be propagated in <em>E. coli</em> cells as well.</p> <h4>The Organic Insecticide <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em></h4> <p><em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> (Bt) is a bacterium that produces protein crystals during sporulation that are toxic to many insect species that affect plants. Bt toxin has to be ingested by insects for the toxin to be activated. Insects that have eaten Bt toxin stop feeding on the plants within a few hours. After the toxin is activated in the intestines of the insects, death occurs within a couple of days. Modern biotechnology has allowed plants to encode their own crystal Bt toxin that acts against insects. The crystal toxin genes have been cloned from Bt and introduced into plants. Bt toxin has been found to be safe for the environment, non-toxic to humans and other mammals, and is approved for use by organic farmers as a natural insecticide.</p> <h4>Flavr Savr Tomato</h4> <p>The first GM crop to be introduced into the market was the Flavr Savr Tomato produced in 1994. Antisense RNA technology was used to slow down the process of softening and rotting caused by fungal infections, which led to increased shelf life of the GM tomatoes. Additional genetic modification improved the flavor of this tomato. The Flavr Savr tomato did not successfully stay in the market because of problems maintaining and shipping the crop.&nbsp;However, since that time numerous crop plants have been developed and approved for sale and consumption. Corn, soybeans, and cotton in particular have been widely adopted by U.S. farmers.</p> <h2>Biotechnology at the Cutting Edge</h2> <p>This video provides an introduction to some of the newest breakthroughs in biotechnology: biofuel, health, and agriculture.</p> <p><script type="text/javascript" src="//static.3playmedia.com/p/projects/20361/files/1280851/plugins/11085.js"></script><script src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api" type="text/javascript"></script><br /> </p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

In this outcome, we’ll learn about the risks and benefits of genomic science.</p> <div class="textbox learning-objectives"><h3>Learning Objectives</h3> <ul><li>Outline how genetic information is used in personal identification</li> <li>Discuss medical uses of genetic information and the potential benefits and risks of this</li> <li>Outline the potential benefits and risks associated with agricultural uses of biotechnology</li> </ul> </div> <h2>Genetic Information Used for Identification</h2> <h3>DNA as a Forensic Tool</h3> <p>Information and clues obtained from DNA samples found at crime scenes have been used as evidence in court cases, and genetic markers have been used in forensic analysis. Genomic analysis has also become useful in this field. In 2001, the first use of genomics in forensics was published. It was a collaborative attempt between academic research institutions and the FBI to solve the mysterious cases of anthrax communicated via the US Postal Service. Using microbial genomics, researchers determined that a specific strain of anthrax was used in all the mailings.</p> <h3>Mitochondrial Genomics</h3> <p>Mitochondria are intracellular organelles that contain their own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA mutates at a rapid rate and is often used to study evolutionary relationships. Another feature that makes studying the mitochondrial genome interesting is that the mitochondrial DNA in most multicellular organisms is passed on only from the mother during the process of fertilization. For this reason, mitochondrial genomics is often used to trace genealogy.</p> <h3>DNA Fingerprinting</h3> <p><strong>DNA fingerprinting</strong>&nbsp;(also called DNA profiling, DNA testing, or DNA typing) is a forensic technique used to identify individuals by characteristics of their DNA. A DNA profile is a small set of DNA variations that is very likely to be different in all unrelated individuals, thereby being as unique to individuals as are fingerprints (hence the name for the technique).</p> <p>Although 99.9% of human DNA sequences are the same in every person, enough of the DNA is different that it is possible to distinguish one individual from another, unless they are monozygotic (“identical”) twins. DNA fingerprinting uses repetitive sequences that are highly variable, called variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs). Modern law enforcement in particular uses short tandem repeats (STRs). STR loci are very similar between closely related individuals, but are so variable that unrelated individuals are extremely unlikely to have the same STRs. The combination of STRs used by law enforcement enable identification though because even closely related individuals will not share all the same STR loci.</p> <p>The modern process of DNA fingerprinting&nbsp;was developed in 1984 by Sir Alec Jeffreys, while he was working in the Department of Genetics at the University of Leicester. DNA fingerprinting can be used&nbsp;to identify a person or to place a person at a crime scene and&nbsp;to help clarify paternity. DNA fingerprinting has also been widely used in the study of animal and floral populations and has revolutionized the fields of zoology, botany, and agriculture.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p>Watch this video on the process of DNA fingerprinting and DNA profilinghttps://youtu.be/DbR9xMXuK7c</p> </div> <h2>Medical Uses of Genetic Information</h2> <h3>Personalized Medicine</h3> <p>Watch this video and consider whether you would be interested in knowing details about your own personal disease risk or susceptibility.</p> <p><script type="text/javascript" src="//static.3playmedia.com/p/projects/20361/files/1280852/plugins/11085.js"></script><script src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api" type="text/javascript"></script><br /> </p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Intervention with lifestyle changes and drugs can be recommended before disease onset. However, this approach is most applicable when the problem resides within a single gene defect. Such defects only account for approximately 5 percent of diseases in developed countries. Most of the common diseases, such as heart disease, are multi-factored or polygenic, which is a phenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes, and also involve environmental factors such as diet. In April 2010, scientists at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual (Stephen Quake, a scientist at Stanford University, who had his genome sequenced); the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases. A risk assessment was performed to analyze Quake’s percentage of risk for 55 different medical conditions. A rare genetic mutation was found, which showed him to be at risk for sudden heart attack. He was also predicted to have a 23 percent risk of developing prostate cancer and a 1.4 percent risk of developing Alzheimer’s. The scientists used databases and several publications to analyze the genomic data. Even though genomic sequencing is becoming more affordable and analytical tools are becoming more reliable, ethical issues surrounding genomic analysis at a population level remain to be addressed.</p> <p>Debate remains over what to do with individual level data as well, such as the data from the genomic analysis of Quake’s DNA. As a result of the study it was recommended that Quake start a regiment of preventative statins; the long-term effects of this study or treatment remain unknown at this stage.</p> <div id="attachment_1502" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1502" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02201013/Figure_B17_02_02.png" alt="The PCA3 test occurs in three steps.

A high concentration of <em>PCA3</em> in urine is indicative of prostate cancer. The <em>PCA3</em> test is considered to be a better indicator of cancer than the more well know PSA test, which measures the level of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) in the blood.</p> </div> <p>For example, in 2011, the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommended against using the PSA test to screen healthy men for prostate cancer. Their recommendation is based on evidence that screening does not reduce the risk of death from prostate cancer. Prostate cancer often develops very slowly and does not cause problems, while the cancer treatment can have severe side effects. The&nbsp;<em>PCA3</em>&nbsp;(Figure 1) test is considered to be more accurate, but screening may still result in men who would not have been harmed by the cancer itself suffering side effects from treatment.</p> <p>What do you think? Should all healthy men be screened for prostate cancer using the <em>PCA3</em> or PSA test? Should people in general be screened to find out if they have a genetic risk for cancer or other diseases?</p> <p>There are no right or wrong answers to these questions. While it is true that prostate cancer treatment itself can be harmful, many men would rather be aware that they have cancer so they can monitor the disease and begin treatment if it progresses. And while genetic screening may be useful, it is expensive and may cause needless worry. People with certain risk factors may never develop the disease, and preventative treatments may do more harm than good.</p> <h3>Pharmacogenomics and Toxicogenomics</h3> <p>Pharmacogenomics, also called toxicogenomics, involves evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drugs on the basis of information from an individual’s genomic sequence. Genomic responses to drugs can be studied using experimental animals (such as laboratory rats or mice) or live cells in the laboratory before embarking on studies with humans. Studying changes in gene expression could provide information about the transcription profile in the presence of the drug, which can be used as an early indicator of the potential for toxic effects. For example, genes involved in cellular growth and controlled cell death, when disturbed, could lead to the growth of cancerous cells. Genome-wide studies can also help to find new genes involved in drug toxicity. Personal genome sequence information can be used to prescribe medications that will be most effective and least toxic on the basis of the individual patient’s genotype. The gene signatures may not be completely accurate, but can be tested further before pathologic symptoms arise.</p> <h3>Microbial Genomics</h3> <h4>Metagenomics</h4> <div id="attachment_1503" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1503" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02201134/Figure_17_04_02.jpg" alt="In metagenomics, all of the genomic DNA from a particular environment is cut into fragments and ligated into a cloning vector.

Metagenomics involves isolating DNA from multiple species within an environmental niche.</p> </div> <p>Traditionally, microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions, which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory. Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly. In addition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist being cultured in isolation. Most microorganisms do not live as isolated entities, but in microbial communities known as biofilms. For all of these reasons, pure culture is not always the best way to study microorganisms. Metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche. Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to analyze the effect of pollutants on the environment (Figure 2).</p> <h4>A Multitude of Benefits</h4> <p>Knowledge of the genomics of microorganisms is being used to find better ways to harness biofuels from algae and cyanobacteria. The primary sources of fuel today are coal, oil, wood, and other plant products, such as ethanol. Although plants are renewable resources, there is still a need to find more alternative renewable sources of energy to meet our population’s energy demands. The microbial world is one of the largest resources for genes that encode new enzymes and produce new organic compounds, and it remains largely untapped. Microorganisms are used to create products, such as enzymes that are used in research, antibiotics, and other anti-microbial mechanisms. Microbial genomics is helping to develop diagnostic tools, improved vaccines, new disease treatments, and advanced environmental cleanup techniques.</p> <h2>Genomics in Agriculture</h2> <p>Genomics can reduce the trials and failures involved in scientific research to a certain extent, which could improve the quality and quantity of crop yields in agriculture. Linking traits to genes or gene signatures helps to improve crop breeding to generate hybrids with the most desirable qualities. Scientists use genomic data to identify desirable traits, and then transfer those traits to a different organism. Scientists are discovering how genomics can improve the quality and quantity of agricultural production. For example, scientists could use desirable traits to create a useful product or enhance an existing product, such as making a drought-sensitive crop more tolerant of the dry season.</p> <div id="watch-headline-title"><h3 class="watch-title-container"><span id="eow-title" class="watch-title" dir="ltr" title="GMO controversies - science vs. public fear: Borut Bohanec at TEDxLjubljana">GMO Controversies: Science versus Public Fear</span></h3> <p>Watch Borut Bohanec, the Chair of the Department of Agronomy at the University of Ljubljana (in Slovenia), as he discusses the fears and potential benefits surrounding GMOs.</p> <p><script type="text/javascript" src="//static.3playmedia.com/p/projects/20361/files/2048761/plugins/11117.js"></script><script src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api" type="text/javascript"></script><br /> </p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.
