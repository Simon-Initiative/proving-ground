<!-- Here is the table of contents for the course. -->

<!-- It consists of a single unordered list. This list can contain either 
     "parts" or "chapters".  A "part" is like a module in an organization in OLI.
     A "chapter" is analagous to a workbook page.  Every part and chapter has a 
     corresponding entry following the table of contents.  

     For every chapter identified in the programming course, create an entry
     in the table of contents and create a corresponding content entry (which
     will contain the actual HTML contents of the chapter)     

     The chapters (pages) can be grouped into modules by preceding them with "parts" 
     definitions.
